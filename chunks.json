Goals establish and drive the action of both training and competition plans. Sport confidence in gymnasts helps to make participation fun and is critical to the gymnast's motivation. Goal Setting Setting goals is a joint effort with the gymnast and coach. The main features of goal setting include the following. Structured into short-term, intermediate and long-term\n\n Stepping stones to success – start small, build big\n\n Must be understood and accepted by the gymnast\n\n Must be reasonable and obtainable\n\n Vary in difficulty – easily attainable to challenging (progressive in nature)\n\n Must be measurable\n\n Goals can be physical, social, or nutritional in nature\n\nLong Term Goal The gymnast will acquire basic Gymnastics skills, appropriate social behavior and functional knowledge of the rules necessary to participate successfully in Gymnastics competitions. Short Term Objectives These are the stepping stones to long term goals. Example: if “functional knowledge of the rules necessary to participate successfully in Gymnastics competitions” is the goal, then some short term objectives would be to:\n\n Use the protocol of saluting the judges prior to and after each routine.  Wait for the judges signal before starting each routine.  Perform a short warm up, then perform parts of the routine ( 1st part, middle section, then end)\n\nthen wait until it is time to perform the entire routine.  Participate in the March in and rotations (Olympic order) to each piece of equipment. To decide on new goals and objectives, look at the skills that need to be learned next on each piece of\n\nequipment and the benefits achieved , based on the gymnast’s weaknesses (. i.e. a balance beam skill of walking sideways on the floor beam and the added benefit of using correct alignment while walking could be a new objective. )\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide – October 2014\n\n7\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide Planning a Gymnastics Training & Competition Season\n\nBenefits of Gymnastics Participation – along with actual skills learned, the gymnast will achieve Physical Benefits – At the conclusion of an extended program a gymnast should demonstrate:\n\n An increase in muscular strength.  An increase in muscular endurance\n\n An increase in muscular flexibility."

Ideally, your gymnasts can train year round (with time for summer vacation). This will give you time to condition your body, to learn new skills, and combine the skills into routines. Learning the routines takes time to memorize and practice for a smooth and consistent pace. Finally, the gymnast must learn how to compete, so setting up practice competitions; demonstrations with people watching, etc. are needed, culminating in your Chapter’s Summer Games or larger competitions (National Games, World Games, Championships). Pre-season planning and preparation\n\n Review the Special Olympics Philosophy and how your coaching philosophy will relate to it. \n\nImprove your knowledge of gymnastics and your spotting skills by attending training schools and gymnastics clinics or through online educational courses through National Federations.  Review the Special Olympics rules for gymnastics.  Locate a facility with equipment for practice sessions (private gymnastics club, university,\n\nrecreation center, Y, etc.)\n\n Recruit volunteer assistant coaches from high school, club or college gymnastics programs\n\n(partners club). Teachers/coaches at the private club might be interested, also.  Train your volunteer coaches on their roles:\n\n Fitness conditioning\n\n Events they will be coaching\n\n First aid\n\n Safety and emergency procedures\n\n Rules for competition (give them needed materials – this guide, rules, music, DVD, SOI\n\nwebsite)\n\n Have them get certified by SOI and registered as a local coach\n\n Get certified by the National Gymnastics Federation/Association.  Recruit other volunteers (parents?) to assist in:\n\n Transporting gymnasts (check insurance)\n\n Budget and fund raising\n\n Public relations\n\n Booster club or parent support groups\n\n Establish a budget and fund raising for transportation, uniforms, miscellaneous items, end of\n\nseason function, etc. Special Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide – October 2014\n\n11\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide Planning a Gymnastics Training & Competition Season\n\n Register your program with your area coordinator and Chapter office. \n\nRecruit gymnasts from schools, workshops, Group Homes, ARC’s, etc.  Obtain all needed gymnast information:\n\n Medical information/release (+ x-rays for gymnasts with Down Syndrome) If a gymnast has\n\nbeen in another SO sport, they will already have these forms. (get a copy of them)\n\n Registration/parent release\n\n 2 emergency phone numbers\n\n Establish your goals/objectives for the season\n\n Write a training plan for the year with the help of your assistant coaches\n\n Plan mini-meets with other coaches\n\n Meet with parents; educate them as to what you are doing and how they can help. 12\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide – October 2014\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide Planning a Gymnastics Training & Competition Season\n\nSeason Planning\n\n\n\nInitiate your season with skills assessment and continue to use assessments to keep track of your gymnasts progress. The initial assessment will determine:\n\n Gymnast’s strength\n\n Gymnast’s flexibility\n\n Gymnast’s coordination\n\n Gymnast’s skill knowledge\n\n Gymnast’s ability to stay on task/concentrate\n\n Gymnast’s behavior/social skills\n\n Determine which level and event your gymnasts should participate in, based on:\n\n\n\nInitial assessment\n\n Age\n\n Sex\n\n Gymnast preference\n\n Other internal factors:\n\n Enjoyment of music, dancing\n\n Mental readiness and fear\n\n External factors:\n\n Time\n\n Facility\n\n Equipment\n\n Coaches expertise\n\n Establish initial goals and objectives as needed for each gymnast. For ease of practice, it is\n\npossible to separate the gymnasts into groups, differentiating the skills taught, based on the group.  As the season progresses, the gymnasts should go through a consistent progression from lead up\n\ndrills, to skills, to combination of skills, to routines, to competition of routines.  Each practice should contain:\n\n Warm up, including locomotor drills (see warm up in Teaching Skills section)\n\n Body position drills (done on floor first in warm ups)\n\n Rotations to different apparatus\n\n Review previous material\n\n\n\nIntroduce new skills/drills\n\n Conditioning (strength, cardiovascular, flexibility, coordination,)\n\n Comments and closing (build self confidence)\n\n To increase training, send gymnasts home with a DVD of safe conditioning, flexibility, and balance\n\nexercises they can do at home in front of the TV (WII for gymnastics??)\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide – October 2014\n\n13\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide Planning a Gymnastics Training & Competition Season\n\nPost Season\n\n Review pre-season goals and determine how many of them were achieved.  Ask for input from the gymnasts and the parents.  Write an assessment of each gymnast and where you want to “go” the next season\n\n Have a post-season party\n\nThere are opportunities for post season competition. 14\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide – October 2014\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide Planning a Gymnastics Training & Competition Season\n\nEssential Components of Planning a Gymnastics Training Session Each training session needs to contain the same essential elements. The amount of time spent on each element will depend on the goal of the training session, the time of season the session is in, and the amount of time available for a particular session. The following elements need to be included in a gymnast’s daily training program. Please refer to the noted sections in each area for more in depth information and guidance on these topics.  Warm ups\n\n Previously taught skills\n\n New Skills\n\n Competition experience\n\n Feedback on performance. The final step in planning a training session is designing what the gymnast is actually going to do. Remember when creating a training session using the key components of a training session, the progression through the session allows for a gradual build up of physical activity. 1."

        "General to specific\n\n6. Start to finish\n\nWarming Up (see teaching skills section for more on this)\n\nAerobic Activity: Music is often used in the aerobic section of the warm-up. The music is often a fast tempo, with a heavy beat emphasis, and the length can be changed as the season progresses and the gymnasts are able to move for a longer period of time (aerobic endurance). A coach would observe their female gymnasts to see which type of music they prefer (for future levels III and IV optional music choices). Having a set warm up routine to the music will ensure that basic motor skills are practiced daily. Range of Motion and basic body position activities: Reviewing the basic body positions (tuck, pike, straddle, stretch and later hollow, arch, and side arch) can be integrated in the warm up. Range of motion moves/stretches can start at the head and work down to the toes or work up from the toes. See the skills section of the guide for a sample warm up. Previously Taught Skills Typically, in a gymnastic practice one would rotate from one event to another. (Mix up your rotations in the early part of the season, since endurance and concentration can waiver near the end of practice, you would want different events to be first, for equal learning.) Near the end of the season, practice in Olympic Order – the order they will compete the events, but the starting event can still rotate. (Olympic order for women – Vault, Uneven Bars, Balance Beam, and Floor Exercise. Olympic order for men – Floor Exercise, Pommel Horse, Rings, Vault, Parallel Bars, horizontal Bar) As you go to each event, practice previously taught skills, then add drills to lead up to the next skill. Special Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide – October 2014\n\n15\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide Planning a Gymnastics Training & Competition Season\n\nNew skills The Whole-part-whole method works for most skills. Demonstrate the entire skill (you, another gymnast, or watch a video of the skill). Then break it down into parts. Teach the separate parts, including any lead up skills. Eventually, you will put the entire skill together (with spotting to ensure success and safety). See the skill instruction section for examples of various skills broken down into lead up skills and spotting of the skills/drills. New skills need to be taught progressively. Start with the level A, then B, then level 1 skills. Use Circuits for reviewing skills, doing new drills, and conditioning. Instead of having gymnasts wait in\n\nline to be spotted, have them do a circuit of skills, with continuous movement up until they get to you (place yourself where you can see everyone). You might be spotting a new skill."
    ],
    [
        "You are not only utilizing time effectively, but reducing the need for any discipline, that might be needed if they are idle. Using props and pictures will help remind them what to do when they are flowing through the circuit. Example: In a cartwheel progression circuit on floor, the gymnasts would travel in a circle. Station A might be a handstand against a padded wall; stations B, C, and D, would be “kick-overs” over blocks, station E would be you, the coach spotting a cartwheel. Station F would be practicing a stretched X (with picture). Repeat (Note: gymnasts should be able to safely do the unspotted skills, having learned them previously)\n\nCircuit:\n\nF\n\nE\n\nA – Against wall\n\nB\n\nC\n\nD\n\nCompetition Experience A variety of experience can and should be lead ups to the area and Chapter games:\n\n\n\nInvite parents into the gym to watch routines (demonstrations)\n\n Perform demonstrations at events.  Organize dual meets against other local teams (invite judges to critique the gymnasts)\n\n Run a Unified meet with partners that have trained with the gymnasts (Partners might be\n\nrelatives – brothers, sisters, cousins, girl scouts, or recreational gymnasts) that would learn the routines alongside the gymnasts for a period of time (8 weeks) then have a Unified meet. The area games should never be the first time the girls or boys do their routines in front of spectators\n\nand judges or put on their competition attire. Feedback on Performance Improving your performance and trying to achieve your personal best is a goal, regardless of the score received. Parents and other interested parties need to keep this in mind. Coaches can help the gymnast and parents understand what the goal(s) for a particular meet are. (i.e. remembering to salute the judge, staying on the beam more than before, etc.) Methods to obtain feedback include:\n\n The judges score. (look at D score, but remember it is just a score!)\n\n Statistics about falls, etc.  A videotape of the routine(s) for gymnast and coach to observe. Judges, if approached after the entire competition is over, will often share feedback about gymnasts\n\nand the team in general. A coach could ask them for this. A taping of the competition could be shared with the gymnast and they could talk about what was going on. This would help you to understand their concept of the experience. 16\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide – October 2014\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide Planning a Gymnastics Training & Competition Season\n\nPrinciples of Effective Training Sessions\n\nKeep all active and controlled\n\nGymnast needs to be an active listener\n\nCreate clear, concise goals\n\nLearning improves when gymnasts know what is expected of them\n\nGive clear, concise instructions\n\nIncrease accuracy of instruction by using all modalities – visual, verbal, and kinesthetic in instructions\n\nRecord progress\n\nYou and your gymnasts chart progress together\n\nGive positive feedback\n\nEmphasize and reward things the gymnast is doing well. Corrections should be stated positively – what you want them to do. Provide variety\n\nVary drills and use circuits – prevent boredom\n\nEncourage enjoyment\n\nTraining and competition is fun, help keep it this way for you and your gymnasts\n\nCreate progressions\n\nLearning is increased when information progresses from:\n\n Known to unknown – discovering new things successfully  Simple to complex – seeing that “I” can do it  General to specific – this is why I am working so hard\n\nPlan maximum use of resources Use what you have and improvise for equipment that you do not\n\nhave – think creatively\n\nAllow for individual differences Different gymnasts, different learning rates, different capacities. Teaching needs to use verbal comments, visual demonstrations, and kinesthetic practice. Use picture cues, videos of good performances, and other gymnasts to demonstrate what you want.

The safety and well-being of gymnasts are the coaches’ primary concerns. Gymnastics is not a dangerous sport, but accidents do occur when coaches forget to take safety precautions. It is the head coach’s and everyone’s responsibility to minimize the occurrence of injuries by providing safe conditions. Risk management should always be considered. Prevention is first.

Gymnasts should not be in the gym or on equipment without proper supervision.  Make sure gymnasts bring water to every practice or provide a water fountain, especially in hotter\n\nclimates.  Check your first aid kit; restock supplies as necessary.  Train all gymnasts and coaches on emergency procedures.  Discuss safety in the gym as well as outside the gym (i.e. parking lot). Have rules about not walking in front of a dismount area; being careful around mats of different heights, etc.  Teach gymnasts to look before walking.  Check the equipment daily. Are all T handles and cables secure? Tripping areas eliminated? All\n\nhazards should be eliminated in the facility.  Review your first-aid and emergency procedures. Have someone who is trained in first-aid and CPR on or very near to the gym during practice and games. Do you know where the AED device is and how to work it ?  All hazards should be eliminated in the facility.  Warm up and stretch properly at the beginning of each practice to prevent muscle injuries.  Train to improve the general fitness level of your gymnasts. Physically fit gymnasts are less likely\n\nto get injured. Make your practices Active.  Require all your gymnasts to wear appropriate uniforms. Loose clothing can get caught around a\n\nbar, in a spotters hand, etc. No jewelry should be worn and long hair tied up.

Hosting a Gymnastic Meet (NOTE: Look on the SOI website for more information on this.)\n\nYour Special Olympics area directors and state office should always be aware of any meets you plan on hosting and approve them. Discuss dates and times with them. Meets for Special Olympics athletes are run the same as meets for NGB gymnasts. The difference is in the awards ceremony. In Special Olympics, everyone is a winner, so everyone goes up to the awards stand for every event and All Around. 20\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide – October 2014\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide Planning a Gymnastics Training & Competition Season\n\nUnified Gymnastics – Selecting Team Members At present, Unified Gymnastics is not in the rule book. Some gyms, clubs and programs are adding it to their programs on a field test basis. The key to the successful development of a traditional Special Olympics or Unified Sports® team is the proper selection of team members. We have provided some primary considerations below for you. In gymnastics, a “team” is 2 gymnasts that are partners. They compete separately, and their scores are added for the team score. Ability Grouping – Partners in Gymnastics Unified gymnastics works best when all partners have similar sports skills. Level I with level I, II with II, etc. Partners with abilities that are far superior to their teammate will either control competition or accommodate others by not competing to their potential. In both situations, the goal of interaction is diminished and a true competitive experience is not achieved. For example, an 8 year old should not be competing with a 30 year old gymnast. Age Grouping All sets of partners should be closely matched in age.  Within 3-5 years of age for gymnasts 21 years of age and under\n\n Within 10-15 years for gymnasts 22 years of age and over\n\nCreating Meaningful Involvement in Unified Sports® Unified Sports® embraces the philosophy and principles of Special Olympics. When selecting your Unified partners you want to achieve meaningful involvement at the beginning, during and end of your sport season. Unified teams are organized to provide meaningful involvement for all gymnasts and partners. Every teammate should play a role and have the opportunity to contribute to the team. Meaningful involvement also refers to the quality of interaction and competition within a Unified Sports® team. Achieving meaningful involvement by all teammates on the team ensures a positive and rewarding experience for everyone. Indicators of Meaningful Involvement\n\n Teammates compete without causing undue risk of injury to themselves or others.  Teammates compete according to the rules of competition.  Teammates have the ability and opportunity to contribute to the performance of the team.  Teammates understand how to blend their skills with those of other gymnasts, resulting in\n\nimproved performance by gymnasts with lesser ability. Meaningful Involvement Is Not Achieved When Team Members\n\n Have superior sports skills in comparison to their\n\nfellow team members.  Act as on coaches, rather than teammates.  Control most aspects of the competition.  Do not train or practice regularly, and only show up\n\non the day of competition."

The Sport Skills Assessment Card is designed to assist coaches in determining gymnast’s ability level in Sport before they begin participation. Coaches will find this assessment a useful tool for several reasons. 1. Help coach to determine with the gymnast which events in which they will compete\n\n2. Establish the baseline training areas of gymnast\n\n3. Assist coaches to group gymnasts of similar ability in training teams\n\n4. Measure the gymnast’s progression\n\n5. Help determine gymnasts daily training schedule\n\nBefore administering the assessment coaches need to perform the following analysis when observing the gymnast.  Become familiar with each of the tasks listed under the major skills\n\n Have an accurate visual picture of each skill.  Have observed a skilled performer executing the skill. When administering the assessment coaches will have a better opportunity in getting the best analysis\n\nfrom their gymnasts. Always begin by explaining the skill you would like to observe. When possible demonstrate the skill. 22\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide – October 2014\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide Planning a Gymnastics Training & Competition Season\n\nSpecial Olympics Sport Skills Assessment Sample\n\nGymnast’s Name\n\nDate\n\nCoach’s Name\n\nDate\n\nInstructions\n\n1.

        "Take particular attention to the faults & fixes charts. Special Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide – October 2014\n\n23\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide Planning a Gymnastics Training & Competition Season\n\nDaily Performance Record The Daily Performance Record (Excel spread sheet) is designed for the coach to keep an accurate record of the gymnast's daily performances as they learn a sports skill. There are several reasons why the coach can benefit from using the Daily Performance Record. 1. The record becomes a permanent documentation of the gymnast's progress\n\n2. Helps the coach establish measurable consistency in the gymnast's training program. 3. The record allows the coach to be flexible during the actual teaching and coaching session because he can break down the skills into specific, smaller tasks that meet the individual needs of each gymnast. 4. The record helps the coach choose proper skills teaching methods, correct conditions and criteria for evaluating the gymnast's performance of the skills. Using the Daily Performance Record An Excel spread sheet will work well for this. At the top of the record, the coach enters his name; the gymnast's name, and their event. If more than one coach works with the gymnast, they should enter the dates that they work with the gymnast next to their names. Before the training session begins, the coach decides what skills will be covered. The coach makes this\n\ndecision based on the gymnast's age, the gymnast's interests, and his mental and physical abilities. The skill needs to be a statement or a description of the specific exercise that the gymnast must perform. The coach enters the skill on the top line of the left-hand column. Each subsequent skill is entered after the gymnast masters the previous skill. Of course, more than one sheet may be used to record all of the skills involved. Also, if the gymnast cannot perform a prescribed skill, the coach may break down the skill into smaller tasks that will allow for the gymnast's success at the new skill. Conditions and Criteria for Mastering After the coach enters the skill, they must then decide on the conditions and criteria by which the gymnast must master the skill. Conditions are special circumstances, which define the manner in which the gymnast must perform a skill. For example, \"given a demonstration, and with assistance\". The coach needs to always operate under the assumption that the ultimate conditions in which the gymnast masters a skill are, \"upon command and without assistance\", and therefore, does not have to enter these conditions in the record next to the skill entry. Ideally, the coach needs to arrange the skills and conditions such that the gymnast gradually learns to perform the skill while upon command and without assistance. Criteria are the standards that determine how well the skill must be performed. The coach needs to\n\ndetermine a standard that realistically suits the gymnast's mental and physical abilities. For example, \"make three strikes, 60 percent of the time\". Given the varied nature of skills, the criteria might involve many different types of standards, such as amount of time, number of repetitions, accuracy, distance or speed. Dates of Sessions and Levels of Instruction Used The coach may work on one task for a couple of days, and may use several methods of instruction during that time to progress to the point where the gymnast performs the task upon command and without assistance. To establish a consistent curriculum for the gymnast, the coach must record the dates he works on particular tasks, and must enter the methods of instruction that were used on those dates. 24\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide – October 2014\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide Planning a Gymnastics Training & Competition Season\n\nGymnastics Attire Appropriate Gymnastics attire is required for all competitors. As a coach, discuss the types of sport clothes that are acceptable and not acceptable for training and competition. Discuss the importance of wearing properly fitted clothing, along with the advantages and disadvantages of certain types of clothing worn during training and competitions. For example, jeans or loose shirts are not proper Gymnastics attire for any event. Explain that they cannot perform while wearing clothes that restrict their movement. Take gymnasts to high school, collegiate, or clubs while training or during competitions and point out the attire being worn. You can even set the example, by wearing appropriate attire to training and competitions and not rewarding gymnasts that do not come properly dressed to train and/or compete. Inappropriate attire could be a safety issue. Buckles, belts, buttons, and large T shirts etc. can get caught when moving around bars, etc. Coaches can get hurt by this inappropriate attire, while spotting. Hearing aids and glasses should be secured. Gymnasts need leotards that allow them their full range of motion.

Guide – October 2014\n\n35\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide Teaching Gymnastics Skills\n\nGeneral Guidelines Warm up, conditioning, and practice drills prepare the Special Olympics athlete for gymnastics. They should be helping the gymnast be prepared for all of the events and include drills to acquire basic and specific physical, physiological and psychological prerequisites. These are some of the more obvious and important items. Physical Strength, flexibility, muscular endurance, agility, cardio-vascular endurance, balance, coordination\n\n Vault – the athlete’s ankles, knees and hips must be strong enough to repel body weight\n\n Bars/Rings/Pommel Horse – the athlete should have adequate grip and upper body strength to\n\nsupport their own weight in a hang or support position for a desired length of time\n\n Beam – the athlete should be able to balance on one foot\n\n Floor Exercise – the athlete should be able to run, walk, slide, skip, hop, gallop, leap as well as roll,\n\ntransfer weight, balance and basic inversions\n\nPhysiological Body weight, distribution of body weight, bone structure, musculature\n\n Vault – even weight distribution, good ankle, knee and hip flexion and extension\n\n Bars/Rings/Pommel Horse – shoulder wrist and elbow joints should be structurally sound\n\n Beam – ability to align the body’s center of gravity over the beam\n\n Floor Exercise – good posture/alignment of shoulders over hips, hips over ankles\n\nCognitive/Psychological Focus, memorization, rhythm, little fear of heights or obstacles\n\nOther General Comments\n\n Keep your work out consistent and include time for strengthening, flexibility and reviewing.  Break down skills into smaller parts, (progressions) teaching them the skill from part to whole."
    ],
    [
        " Building a sound basic foundation of physical skills decreases injuries, increases success rates and\n\nacts as a catalyst for higher level skills.  Network with gymnastics club staff for ideas. Use educational web sites for some insight. Take out\n\nsome books/magazines from the library that not only have information, but also have great pictures to show your athletes.  Promote good hygiene, proper attire, hair fastened securely, no jewelry and empty mouths."
    ],
    [
        " Keep your athletes well hydrated and provide rest breaks when necessary.  Remember Safety First “When In Doubt…Check It Out!”\n\n36\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide – October 2014\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide Teaching Gymnastics Skills\n\nThe Warm Up A warm up period is the first part of every training session or preparation for competition. The warm up starts slowly and gradually involves all muscles and body parts. In addition to preparing the gymnast mentally, warming up also has several physiological benefits. For the female gymnast, incorporating the warm up to music will increase the fun and will also help instill a sense of rhythm and musicality that is important to floor exercise. The importance of a warm up prior to exercise cannot be overstressed. Warming up raises the body\n\ntemperature and prepares the muscles, nervous system, tendons, ligaments, and the cardiovascular system for upcoming stretches and exercises. The chances of injury are greatly reduced by increasing muscle elasticity. Warming Up\n\n Raises body temperature\n\n\n\nIncreases metabolic rate\n\n\n\nIncreases heart and respiratory rate\n\n Prepares the muscles and nervous system for exercise\n\n\n\nInstills a sense of timing and rhythm to music (if used)\n\n Begins the practice session with fun and energy\n\n Stretches the muscles to increase the gymnast’s range of motion\n\n Creates an awareness of correct alignment and body position\n\nThe warm up is tailored for the activity to follow. Warm ups consist of active motion leading up to more vigorous motion to elevate heart, respiratory and metabolic rates. The total warm up period takes at least 25 minutes and immediately precedes the training or competition. A warm up period will include the following basic sequence and components. Activity\n\nPurpose\n\nTime (minimum)\n\nSlow aerobic walk/ fast walk/ run/ locomotor moves\n\nHeat muscles\n\n5 minutes\n\nStretching\n\nIncrease range of movement\n\n10 minutes\n\nEvent Specific Drills\n\nCoordination preparation for training/competition\n\n10 minutes\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide – October 2014\n\n37\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide Teaching Gymnastics Skills\n\nAerobic Warm-Up Activities such as walking, light jogging, walking while doing arm circles, chasse, skipping, runs with leaps, etc. Walking Gymnasts begin warming the muscles by walking slowly for 3-5 minutes. This circulates the blood through all the muscles, thus providing them greater flexibility for stretching. The sole objective of the warm up is to circulate the blood and warm the muscles in preparation for more strenuous activity. Running and other locomotor movements Running, skipping, galloping, chasse’s etc., are next. Gymnasts begin warming the muscles by running or other movement slowly for 3-5 minutes. This circulates the blood through all the muscles, thus providing them greater flexibility for stretching. The run starts out slowly, and then gradually increases in speed; however, the gymnast never reaches even 50 percent of their maximum effort by the end of the movements. Remember, the sole objective of this phase of the warm up is circulating the blood and warming the muscles in preparation for more strenuous activity. Games, as seen in this video can be incorporated in this phase of the warm up. 38\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide – October 2014\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide Teaching Gymnastics Skills\n\nStretching/Flexibility/Range of Motion (Warm up and Cool down) Stretching is one of the most critical parts of the Warm Up and a gymnast’s performance. A more flexible muscle is a stronger and healthier muscle. A stronger and healthier muscle responds better to exercise and activities and helps prevent injury. Flexibility is critical to a gymnast’s optimal performance in both training and competition. Flexibility is achieved through stretching. Stretching follows an easy aerobic jog or other locomotor activity at the start of a training session or competition. Begin with an easy stretch to the point of tension, and hold this position for 15-30 seconds until the pull lessens. When the tension eases, slowly move further into the stretch until tension is again felt. Hold this new position for an additional 15 seconds. Each stretch should be repeated 4-5 times on each side of the body. It is also important to continue to breathe while stretching. As you lean into the stretch, exhale. Once the stretching point is reached, keep inhaling and exhaling while holding the stretch. Stretching should be a part of everyone’s daily life. Regular, daily stretching has been demonstrated to have the following effects. 1. Increase the length of the muscle-tendon unit\n\n2. Increase joint range of motion\n\n3. Reduce muscle tension\n\n4. Develop body awareness\n\n5. Promote increased circulation\n\n6. Make you feel good\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide – October 2014\n\n39\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide Teaching Gymnastics Skills\n\nSome gymnasts, like those with Down Syndrome, may have low muscle tone that makes them appear more flexible. Be careful to not allow these gymnasts to stretch beyond a normal, safe range. Extremely flexible gymnasts should develop the strength to control their flexibility. Stretching is effective only if the stretch is performed accurately. Gymnasts need to focus on correct body positioning and alignment. Another common fault in stretching is bending the back in an attempt to get a better stretch from the hips. An example is a simple sitting forward leg stretch. Incorrect\n\nCorrect\n\nFlexibility is needed in gymnastics. This is obtained through stretching."

        "In this guide, we will focus on some basic stretches and range of motion exercises. Along the way we\n\nwill also point out some common faults, illustrate corrections and identify stretches that are event specific. We will start at the top of the body and work our way to the legs and feet. 40\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide – October 2014\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide Teaching Gymnastics Skills\n\nUpper Body\n\nSide Stretch\n\n Raise arms over head\n\n Clasp forearms or reach overhead with top arm\n\n Bend to one side\n\nThe position is incorrect when the athlete pushes the\n\nhips to the side, weights the feet unevenly or bends a\n\nknee. Wrist and Shoulders\n\nWrist sequence – “ocean waves”\n\nPalms together – pushing, up, down\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide – October 2014\n\n41\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide Teaching Gymnastics Skills\n\nNeck Exercises to warm up the neck will teach the athlete to use the head in different positions. It is important for the body to remain motionless, in alignment, when the athlete moves the head. In rhythmic gymnastics, the athlete will move the head to follow the hand apparatus, especially on tosses, and in the choreography of competition routines. Note – never circle the head in a complete rotation or move the head forcefully\n\nLook up and down\n\nLook side to side\n\nTilt side to side\n\n42\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide – October 2014\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide Teaching Gymnastics Skills\n\nArms and Shoulders Many skills in gymnastics require shoulder flexibility. Shoulder flexibility is important for supple body waves and an elegant carriage of the upper body. Arm Circles\n\nTorso and Back In floor exercise and balance beam, torso and back flexibility are important for some skills. Skills, such as body waves, require the athlete to move with suppleness from an arched to a contracted position or from a contraction on one side to a contraction on the other side. A supple torso and back will give the athlete the appearance of moving effortlessly from one element to the next. Cat Stretch This exercise will develop the supple back movement for body waves. The athlete kneels on the hands and knees\n\nThe athlete shows an arched position\n\nThe athlete's back moves in a supple manner to a contracted position\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide – October 2014\n\n43\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide Teaching Gymnastics Skills\n\nBackbend The backbend is an acrobatic element that increases back flexibility. When spotting the backbend from a stand, the coach must support the athlete with one hand under the back and one hand under the shoulder. Athletes who have Down Syndrome and have been diagnosed with atlanto-axial instability should not do this exercise.

The gymnast is not bending from his hips and not getting the maximum benefit of the stretch\n\nHere, the gymnast is correctly bringing his chest to his feet and not pulling his toes towards his body\n\nHamstring Stretch\n\nSeated Straddle Stretch\n\n Legs straight out and together  Legs are not locked  Bend at hips, reach toward ankles  As flexibility increases, reach for feet  Push out through the heels, forcing toes to the sky\n\n Legs straddled, bend at hips  Reach out toward the middle, then each\n\nleg\n\n Keep the back straight\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide – October 2014\n\n45\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide Teaching Gymnastics Skills\n\nLegs and Feet Strength and flexibility of the legs and feet are of the utmost importance for rhythmic gymnastics. All jumps, leaps and high kicks should be performed with the legs and feet extended. Pivots and balances must be executed with the athlete standing high on the toes, with a straight supporting leg. Point and Flex\n\nThe athlete sits in a pike position and points and flexes the feet. Lunge (on one knee)\n\nIn the correct lunge position, the knee will be directly over the foot. In the incorrect lunge position, the knee will be in front of the foot. 46\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide – October 2014\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide Teaching Gymnastics Skills\n\nSplits\n\nFront split\n\nGymnasts should face forward and square the hips.

Most strength exercises can be done during rotations to each piece of apparatus and incorporated within the skills done. The following core strength can be done during warm ups:\n\nSuperman – For Lower Back, Upper Shoulders\n\n Lie on stomach, lift arms and legs\n\n Hold or rock\n\n For lower back – while lying on stomach, lift one\n\n Add a roll onto back (hollow), then stomach\n\nleg, then another. (arch)\n\n Hold."

        " Build from a few to numerous lifts. Plank\n\n Hold a push up position\n\n(supported by hands or elbows)\n\n Roll over and hold a straight body position on your back. Special Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide – October 2014\n\n49\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide Teaching Gymnastics Skills\n\nTabletop Doing a Tabletop is an easier version to develop core strength. Not only is it important for the athlete to be able to arch and contract the back, but he/she must also\n\nbe capable of maintaining a straight body position. Doing sit ups, crunches and V sits will also increase core strength and can be done in warm ups or\n\ndistributed throughout the workout and cool down. Tight Body Keeping a tight body during many skills in gymnastics is very important. Isolating it in drills helps the gymnast realize what they are being asked to do, as well as help strengthen the core. 50\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide – October 2014\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide Teaching Gymnastics Skills\n\nEvent Specific Drills Drills are activities designed to teach sport skills. Progressions of learning start at a low ability level, advance to an intermediate level, and finally, reach a high ability level. Encourage each gymnast to advance to their highest possible level. Drills can be combined with warm-up, such as jumping practice and lead into specific skill development. They are also often done at each event, as you rotate around the gym. Skills are taught and reinforced through repetition of a small segment of the skill to be performed. Many times, the actions are exaggerated in order to strengthen the muscles that perform the skill. Each coaching session should take the gymnast through the entire progression so that he/she is exposed to all of the skills that make up an event. Specific Warm Up Activities\n\n\n\nJumping (floor ex, vault, etc.) – practice a variety of jumps in warm up.  Walking through the locomotor movements used in their floor and beam routines without arm\n\nmovements, once learned, add the arm movements.  Drill the basic body positions (tuck, pike, straddle, stretch)\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide – October 2014\n\n51\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide Teaching Gymnastics Skills\n\nThe Cool Down The cool down is as important as the warm up, however is often ignored. Stopping an activity abruptly may cause pooling of the blood and slow the removal of waste products in the gymnast's body. It may also cause cramps, soreness, and other problems for Special Olympics gymnasts. The cool down gradually reduces the body temperature and heart rate and speeds the recovery process before the next training session or competitive experience. The cool down is also a good time for the coach and gymnast to talk about the session or competition. Note that cool down is also a good time to do stretching. Muscles are warm and receptive to stretching movements. Cool Down Activity\n\nPurpose\n\nTime (minimum)\n\nSlow aerobic loco motor movements\n\nLowers body temperature Gradually lowers heart rate\n\n5 minutes\n\nStretching\n\nRemoves waste from muscles\n\n5 minutes\n\n52\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide – October 2014\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide Teaching Gymnastics Skills\n\nBody Positions The basic body positions of stretch, pike, straddle, and tuck can be found used on all pieces of apparatus. Teaching and reviewing these positions (and arch and contract or hollow) during warm up in a game type atmosphere is appropriate for Special Olympic gymnasts. Stretch Body Position\n\nStretch position on various pieces of equipment. Inverted or upright, it is a common position. In stretch, gymnasts should have tight core body strength, legs together, and toes pointed.

Special Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide – October 2014\n\n159\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide Teaching Gymnastics Skills\n\nTeaching Balance Beam Skills (Women)\n\nGeneral Guidelines\n\n Teach, isolate, practice and reinforce all head, body, leg and arm positions on a mat and floor line.  Expect and encourage the best posture and alignment at each practice.  Take the time to teach all athletes how to perform Safe Landing Positions from platforms\n\ngradually increasing in height. This includes safety rolls forward, side and back. They must learn to jump away from the beam and land safely if their balance is lost and non-negotiable.  Give your athletes some time to explore the balance beam; crawling, sitting, alternating weight\n\nfrom left to right foot and turning around like a ballerina music box.  All skills need to be mastered on a floor line before performing them on a four inch wide balance\n\nbeam.  All skills need to be proficient on a low/floor beam before performing on a high beam.  Try not to isolate skills but combine them into short patterns or combinations. Moving in and out of skills with changes in rhythm is what constitutes a great routine because it creates a flow of movement.  Use a lot of visual cues, props, cue words, games and perhaps a point system or skill chart with\n\nstars.  Bean bags, plastic 4’ rods/noodles, sidewalk chalk, painters tape, small stuffed animals, plastic dots, scarves, soft ropes of yarn and anything that is basically safe are helpful to have around. They keep your athletes more productive and focused on the task at hand.  Try doing your line/floor/beam drills to music. This helps create rhythm in their routines."

        "See below for more ideas. Modifying Exercises Modify the drills involved in acquiring a skill so that all gymnasts can participate. For example, if a gymnast is afraid to do a forward roll, have them do back rocks to standing (ending of a roll) and lean over barrels to touch the floor as the beginning of a roll. Once they are comfortable with both, combine them. Accommodating a Gymnast’s Special Needs See the rulebook – Examples: a rope along the runway for visually impaired gymnasts to hold onto for vaulting, a hand signal for floor exercise to start for auditory impaired, and most of the level A accommodations allow gymnasts of all abilities to participate. Modifying Your Communication Method Different gymnasts require different communications systems. For example, some gymnasts learn and respond better to demonstrated skills, others need to feel how it feels (be spotted through it), whereas others require greater verbal communication. Some gymnasts may need a combination – to see, hear, feel and even read a description of the skill. Modifying Equipment Successful participation for some gymnasts requires equipment modifications to suit their particular need. The floor might need to be raised if the bars/rings cannot be lowered sufficiently. Raise the floor with mats or spotting blocks. Adaptations More specific adaptations for Gymnastics are listed below. Orthopedic Impairments*\n\n1. In level A, a coach may remove wheelchair or walker and assist gymnast to starting position without penalty\n\n2. Spotting is acceptable to assist gymnast. (the score will be lowered for this, however)\n\nAuditory Impairments* Use hand signal for start with music. Special Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide – October 2014\n\n177\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide Teaching Gymnastics Skills\n\nVisual Impairments*\n\n1. Use a shorter approach or start with a stand on the board for vaulting."

        "Using a rope down the runway is also acceptable. 2. Allowing the gymnast to touch the equipment before starting is acceptable. Please tell the meet referee prior to competition of any accommodations that are being used and why, so they can tell all of the judges. Mental Preparation and Training Mental training is important for the gymnast, whether striving to do his or her personal best or competing against others. Mental imagery, what Bruce D. Hale of Penn State calls “No Sweat Practice,” is very effective. The mind cannot tell the difference between what is real and what is imagined. Practice is practice, regardless of whether it is mental or physical. Ask the gymnast to sit in a relaxed position, in a quiet place with few distractions. Tell the gymnast to\n\nclose their eyes and picture performing a particular skill correctly. Each is seeing them self on a large movie screen on a beam, pommel horse, etc."

    [
        "Walk them through the skill step by step. Use as much detail as possible, using words to elicit all the senses – sight, hearing, touch, and smell. Ask the gymnast to repeat the image, picture rehearsing the skill successfully – even to the point of seeing the entire routine completed and saluting the judge. For Example, gymnast A had difficulty staying on the beam. She fell off repeatedly while walking forward to the middle of the beam. She learned to visualize herself walking upright, without wobbles to the middle of the beam. Some gymnasts need help to start the process. Others will learn to practice this way on their own. The link between performing the skills in the mind and performing the skills in the gym may be hard to explain. However, the gymnast who repeatedly imagines them self correctly completing a skill and believing it to be true is more likely to make it happen. Whatever goes into one’s mind and one’s heart comes out in their actions. Cross Training in Gymnastics Cross training is a modern day term which refers to the substitution of skills other than the skills directly involved in the performance of an event. Cross training came about as a result of injury rehabilitation and is now also used in injury prevention. When gymnasts sustain injuries in the legs or feet that keeps them from running, other activities can be substituted (i.e. swimming) so that the gymnast can keep up his/her aerobic and muscular strength. There is a limited value and cross over to the specific exercise. A reason to \"cross train\" is to avoid injury and maintain muscular balance during a period of intense sport specific training. One of the keys to success in sport is staying healthy and training over the long haul. Cross training allows gymnasts to do event-specific training workouts with greater enthusiasm and intensity, or less risk of injury. Gymnastics is inherently a sport that uses cross training within itself, due to the different events. Vaulting and tumbling use quick high intensity lower body strength and movements, while balance beam uses slower, deliberate movements and pommel horse, rings, and bars use upper body strength. 178\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide – October 2014\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide Teaching Gymnastics Skills\n\nHome Training Program\n\n1. If gymnasts only train once a week with their coaches and do no training on their own, progress will be very limited. General fitness, strength and core training as well as balance practice can only enhance what is done in the gym. Female gymnasts would benefit from dance classes, as well. 2. A Gymnast Handbook/Home Training Guide can be downloaded from the Special Olympics website to assist coaches in integrating Home Training into their season, as well as helping gymnasts and families with ideas on how to practice between practices! 3."

        "Nothing improves the gymnast’s sport ability like a challenge! Parents/Guardians can challenge the gymnast to unified competitions with family members for additional practice. (balance beam – line on floor (chalk?), playground bars for single bar, etc. )\n\n4. To be effective, coaches should run a home training orientation for family members and/or training partners. This should be an active session where partners get hands-on experience with the different activities. (Conditioning, practice with floor routine (without tumbling), or balance beam, etc.)\n\n5. As a motivational tool, a coach may want to award a certificate of Achievement to gymnasts and training partners who complete a set number of home training sessions during the season.

        "190\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide – October 2014\n\n181\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide Gymnastics Rules, Protocol & Etiquette\n\nTeaching Gymnastics Rules The best time to teach the rules of Gymnastics is during practice. For example, place a stuffed animal near the equipment with the label “JUDGE” on it. Have the gymnast practice saluting the judge before and after each routine. Please refer to Official Special Olympics Sports Rules Book for the complete listing of Gymnastics rules. Gymnastic Levels in Competition See the Artistic Gymnastic Rules on the SOI website for the official rules. This is just a quick overview. Gymnasts may be specialists (do one or more of the events) or All Around gymnasts, where they do all of the events at that level. Levels A and B Very short, simple routines in 4 events. Both sexes do the same routines, but are in different divisions during competition.  Level A: Is written for gymnasts who have additional physical issues that would impede their\n\nability to do a higher level.  Level B: Is written for individuals who are unable to remember or unable to participate in Level I. Women may add music to their floor routine. Level A gymnast on Wide Beam. Level I Women do the 4 events (vaulting, uneven bars, balance beam and floor exercise) in short compulsory routines. (See rulebook) Men do the 6 Olympic events (floor exercise, pommel horse, high bar, parallel bars, rings, and vaulting) in short compulsory routines. (Compulsory routines are written specifically so that everyone does the exact same skills in the same order.)\n\nLevel II Men & Women do the same events, as in level I, but the compulsory routines at this level are slightly longer and a little harder. Level III Men & Women do the same events, as in levels I & II, but are given a list of skills to be put in their own routine. Women may choose their own floor music. 182\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide – October 2014\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide Gymnastics Rules, Protocol & Etiquette\n\nLevel IV OPTIONALS (see glossary) the mainstream artistic codes (FIG and national respective NGB’s) are such that they are a very good basis on which to form the rules for people with disabilities. It is therefore essential that coaches and judges should be familiar with their respective mainstream Men’s or Women’s artistic rules. Special Olympic accommodations are in the rulebook. Many gymnasts may not receive full difficulty, but will still be very competitive in Special Olympic meets. Level IV Gymnast Vaulting\n\nThis level allows a coach to formulate a routine using the strengths and weaknesses of the individual gymnasts to their best advantage. Judging Artistic Gymnastics Throughout practice, once gymnasts know how to do their skills, a coach could explain the execution and amplitude deductions to his/her gymnasts. Showing how legs apart, flexed ankles legs, and other such form breaks can lower their score. Then practice executing all skills with good form. Before the first competition, explain the judging (see judging sheets at the SOI website) to the parents and athletes. Unified Sports® Rules At present, Unified Gymnastics is not in the rule book. Some gyms, clubs, and programs are adding it to their programs on a field test basis. Unified Gymnastics is competition and practice in pairs. Two gymnasts – one a Special Olympics athlete, the other a Unified Partner – practice and learn the routines together. They then compete and their scores are added together for the “team” score. It has occurred more than once where the judge had no idea which person was the Special Olympics athlete! 1."

        "A roster consists of a proportionate number of partners. Partners should be in the same age group. 2. Partners compete at the same level in all events. If there are enough judges and equipment, partners could compete simultaneously. 3. Divisioning is based on their level of competition (levels A, B, I, II, III, or IV). 4."

Special Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide – October 2014\n\n183\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide Gymnastics Rules, Protocol & Etiquette\n\nWhere do Unified Partners come from? A variety of places are potential sites to get partners of similar age:\n\n\n\nIf the Special Olympics athlete is taking a recreational gymnastic class, any classmate could be a partner and come to the unified practices.  Family members that are similar ages and same sex – cousins, brothers, sisters, and even a parent\n\nof an adult gymnast.  Girl Scouts or Boy scouts.  Classmates of students that are in inclusion classes…\n\n High School students that need volunteer time for graduation, etc. More information about Unified Gymnastics is in the Planning section of this guide. Unified Partners in a Rhythmic Gymnastics Competition. Protest Procedures and Coaches’ Expectations Protest procedures are governed by the rules of competition. The role of the competition management team is to enforce the rules. As coach, your duty to your gymnasts and team is to protest any action or events while your gymnast is competing that you think violated the Official Gymnastics Rules. It is extremely important that you do not make protests because you and your gymnast did not get your desired outcome of an event. A protest is a serious matter that impacts a competition’s schedule. Check with the competition team prior to competition to learn the protest procedures for that competition. Judging decisions cannot be protested. An inquiry could be submitted if there was an issue with any equipment, music, or divisioning using the Special Olympics guidelines. Coaches need to do this in a timely manner. (Check coaches manual at competition)\n\n184\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide – October 2014\n\nSpecial Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Coaching Guide Gymnastics Rules, Protocol & Etiquette\n\nThe Coach is additionally obligated during meets to\n\n Obtain a Special Olympics certification in gymnastics (before your first practice).  Show professional behavior (see sportsmanship)."

Almost everyone wants to own their own busi- ness – it is the new American dream."

According to the Small Business Administration\t(SBA),\tnearly\t672,000\tnew\tcompanies\t were created in 2005; 30,000 more start-ups than in 2004 and 12% more than the height of the dot.com boom. Last year, immigrants started 25% more new companies than native-born citizens. Becoming your own boss has become a national obsession. This book is not intended to be the end-all road map\n\nfor your success as the owner of a gymnastics busi- ness.

        "If you are looking for ideas in certain areas, look about the manual, if you don’t find what you are looking for in the first place you think of…keep look- ing. With this manuscript, a compilation of articles and information based on common sense, recom- mendations from various organizations, authors and experts, I eagerly share some experience and knowl- edge in an effort to present some “Best Practices for the Gymnastics Business.” In this manual, some topics will be presented for your consideration, alternative options will be investigated, and ideas will be given to help organizations improve their operations through best practices of risk management, human resources, business planning, etc. The gymnastics industry has evolved over the years and many great books have been published relating to the sport but most have focused on athlete training, skill development, coaching principles and condition- ing. There have been a few gymnastics business related books printed but Best Practices for the Gymnastics Business is intended to establish some standards for successful operation of gymnastics organizations. It is the hope of this program to raise the standard by which gym owners operate their business and con- duct their operations to help gymnastics become the benchmark by which other youth sport businesses are judged. As solutions are presented to these and other ideas,\n\nplease understand that this is a dynamic work in progress."

Most gymnastics teachers and coaches do not own\n\na gym. They either teach or coach in someone else’s gym or they work within a school, a YMCA, or some other not-for-profit based organization. If your goal is to teach and coach gymnastics, there are thousands of opportunities available to you within the existing gym- nastics community. And as we shall see, in many cases you will make more money and have fewer responsibili- ties if you work for someone else than if you open your own gym. In view of these sobering facts, it is imperative that you be clear on why you want to open your own gym- nastics school. In most cases the simple desire to teach and coach gymnastics and the skill set that you have developed as a gymnastics teacher will not be enough to make your dream of owning a gymnastics school a reality…or at least a very pleasant reality. In most cases, the reason to open a gymnastics\n\nbusiness is exactly the same as the reason to open any other business. Businesses are formed in order to make money. The way you will try make a profit is by teach- ing gymnastics, but the goal will be to make a profit. Remember that it is very difficult to do a great job teaching gymnastics if you cannot pay the rent, if the gas is disconnected, of if the paychecks do not clear the bank. Your employees will not settle for the simple joy of seeing a child’s eyes light up the first time they make a back handspring by themselves, they will also want to get paid. And of course you will want to get paid as well. After all, since it is your gym, you are the one who has invested the money, time, and effort into getting the gym business up and running. If anyone deserves to get paid it is you."

        "And yet the truth is that the owner gets paid last. If there is anything left after all the bills are\tcovered\tand\tthe\temployees\tpaid\t(along\twith\tthe\t taxes\tand\tbenefits),\tand\tif\tsufficient\tfunds\thave\tbeen\t set aside for upcoming bills and expenses, then and\n\n13\n\nBusiness Basics\n\nonly then does the owner get compensated for all his or her hard work and investment.

        "There is nothing easy about it. But it can be rewarding and very, very exciting to watch something terrific take shape and grow where nothing existed before. You are your own boss\n\nWhat does it mean to be the boss? Does it mean that\n\nyou get to order everyone around and give everyone else the tough jobs while you sit back and coach the team kids? It can if you want to do everything yourself. Because no one will be willing to work for you if you act like that. So, what does it mean? It means that you take all the risk, you work the\n\nhardest, you lead by example, you take the tough jobs, and you get all the phone calls that no one wants to get. It also means that you set the standards, you chart the direction the gym will take, you set the gym up the way you want it organized, you work only with those you want to work with, and you get to see your dream take shape. You also reap any profits the gym might generate. What kind of business should you start?"

        "Before starting a business, one of the most important\n\ndecisions to make is what type of business you want. For many beginning entrepreneurs, deciding what type of business to start is a difficult consideration. Because you are reading this book, you are obviously half-way toward making a decision. Saying you want to start a gym nastics school is very much like saying you want to buy a car. What kind of car do you want? Toyota? Ford? Cadillac? SUV? Or Sports car? The possibilities are amazing-in cars and gymnastics busi ness types. In this decision process, first consider what you would like to do and how good you are at managing people and money, and the time and\n\nBest Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nenergy you have to devote to these important tasks. Then consider the many decisions that will determine your school’s approach. How large do you want your facility to be? Do you want a mobile program operated from a van or a bus? Will you offer boys’ and girls’ instructional programs? Will you offer preschool programs? Competition programs? General Gymnastics performance groups? Adult pro grams? Will you offer auxiliary programs like rock climbing, dance or karate? Cheerleading and tum- bling? Power tumbling?"

        "The list of possibilities grows larger each year. many people shy away from sales because they do not want to feel they are manipulating the customer. Sales and manipulation are very different interactions. Manipulation is convincing a person to take your product or service regardless of their needs. This may cause a person to resent you and your company. Sales is the process of matching your product or service to the customer’s needs. The first step is to determine whether or not the person wants or needs what you have to sell. There is a great deal of information on the sales process available at libraries and bookstores. Sales is an art form that requires practice, so do your homework. Will your business succeed? You sacrifice, work hard, and make all the right deci-\n\nOnce you have decided to start your own business, you need to define and sell your product. What are you selling? To whom are you selling? Why are you selling this particular product or service? Is there a market? How much are you going to charge? Nothing happens in business until something is sold. Selling is an essential part of a suc cessful business, but\n\nsions-but success depends on how much money you have to back up your venture. You must have enough capital to stay afloat until your business is generating more income than it is paying out. In the following chapters, we will address many of these issues that often keep new business owners from succeeding. PAID ADVERTISEMENT\n\n14\n\nBest Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nchoosinG the riGht leGal Business structure\n\nTHE MAIN BUSINESS STRUCTURES\n\nYou probably already have a rough idea of the type of legal structure your business will take. That’s because the ownership structure that’s right for your busi- ness—a sole proprietorship, partnership, LLC, or cor- poration—depends on how many people will own the business and what type of services or products it will provide, things you’ve probably thought about already. For instance, if you know that you will be the only owner, then a partnership is obviously not your thing. And\tif\tyour\tbusiness\twill\tengage\tin\trisky\tactivities\t(for\t example,\tgymnastics!),\tyou’ll\tnot\tonly\twant\tto\tbuy\t insurance, but also consider forming an entity that pro- vides personal liability protection, which can shield your personal assets from business debts and claims. If you plan to raise capital by selling stock to the booster club or want to give your employees stock options, then you should form a corporation. LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY (LLC) One basic distinction that you’ll probably hear\n\nmentioned lots of times is the difference between busi- nesses that provide owners with “limited liability” and those that don’t. Corporations and LLCs both provide owners with limited personal liability. Sole proprietor- ships and general partnerships do not. Limited liability means that the creditors of the busi-\n\nness cannot normally go after the owners’ personal assets to pay for business debts and claims arising from lawsuits. The decision to form a limited liability entity can dramatically affect how you run your business. On the other hand, while sole proprietorships and partnerships are somewhat simpler to run than corporations and LLCs, they may leave an owner personally vulnerable to business lawsuits and debts. If you’ve considered these issues, then you’ll be ahead of the game in choosing a legal structure that’s right for your business. Still, you’ll need to consider the benefits and drawbacks of each type of business structure before you make your final decision. In all states, the basic types of business structures are:\n\nSOLE PROPRIETORSHIP\n\nA sole proprietorship is simply a business that is owned by one person and papers to become a corpo- ration or an LLC have not been filed. Sole proprietor- ships are easy to set up and to maintain. limited\tliability\tcompanies\t(LLCs) •\t sole\tproprietorships •\t partnerships\t(general\tand\tlimited) •\t corporations\n\nTo help you pick the best structure for your business, this chapter explains the basic attributes of each type. And it will also help you answer the most common ques- tion new entrepreneurs ask about choosing a business form: Should I choose a business structure that offers protection from personal liability—a corporation or an LLC? Here’s a hint as to what the best advice will be: If you focus energy and money into getting your business off the ground as a sole proprietorship or a partnership, you can always incorporate or form an LLC later. If you plan to start a sole proprietorship and expect that your spouse may occasionally help out with busi- ness tasks, you should be aware that the IRS typically allows a spouse to pitch in without pay without risking being classified as an owner or as an employee of the other spouse’s business. This situation is sometimes er- roneously called a “husband-wife sole proprietorship.” From a legal standpoint, someone who does work for a business must be one of three things: a co-owner, an employee, or an independent contractor. But when that someone is your spouse, this rule is softened somewhat. Your spouse can volunteer—that is, work without pay—for your sole proprietorship without be- ing classified as an employee, freeing the business from paying payroll tax. 15\n\nBest Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nThat saves you money—and, if you have no other employees, also allows you to avoid the time-consum- ing record keeping involved in being an employer. Similarly, a spouse who is not classified as a partner or an independent contractor won’t have to pay self-em- ployment taxes, and your business won’t have to file a partnership tax return. Under marital property laws that vary from state to state, if a business is started or significantly changed when a couple is married, both spouses may have an ownership interest in the business regardless of whose name is on the ownership document. You may want to check with a lawyer who is experienced in handling marital property issues to see how your business could be affected in the event of a divorce in your particular state. Finally, if you and your spouse both want to be active partners in a co-owned business— each with an official say in management—you should create a partner- ship or an LLC or corporation, even though this will mean filing somewhat more complicated tax returns and other business paperwork. If your spouse tries to squeak by as a volunteer in a so-called husband-wife sole proprietorship when you’re really working together as a partnership, you run the risk of being audited and having the IRS declare you’re a partnership—and sock your spouse with back self-employment taxes. Setting up a sole proprietorship is incredibly easy. You generally don’t have to file any special forms or pay any special fees to start working as a sole proprietor. You’ll simply declare your business to be a sole proprietorship when completing the general registration requirements that apply to all new businesses, such as getting a busi- ness license from your county or city or a seller’s permit from your state. Local registration requirements\n\nMost cities and many counties require businesses to register with them and pay at least a minimum tax. And if you do business under a name different from your own, such as DBA Gymnastics, you usually must register that name—known as a fictitious business name—with your local municipality or county. There is more information on government requirements later in this chapter. When filing for a business tax registration certificate\n\nwith your city, you’ll often be asked to declare what kind of business you’re starting. Some cities require only that you check a “sole proprietorship” box on a form, while other cities have separate tax registration forms for sole proprietorships. Similarly, other forms\n\n16\n\nyou’ll file, such as those to register a fictitious business name and to obtain a seller’s permit, will also ask for this information. Taxes\n\nNo matter what structure you choose, once your business is underway and turning a profit, you’ll have to start paying taxes. Taxes can get fairly complicated and you may need some in-depth guidance. Talk to an accountant and/or your attorney for advice. A sole proprietorship is not legally separate from the person who owns it. This is one of the fundamental dif- ferences between a sole proprietorship and a corpora- tion or LLC, and it has two major effects: one related to taxation and the other to personal liability. At income tax time, a sole proprietor simply reports\n\nall business income or losses on his or her individual income tax return. The business itself is not taxed. The IRS calls this “pass-through” taxation, because business profits pass through the business to be taxed on the business owner’s tax return. You report income from a business just like wages from a job, except that, along with Form 1040, you’ll need to include Schedule C, on which you’ll provide your business’s profit and loss information. One helpful aspect of this arrangement is that if your business loses money— and, of course, many start-ups do in the first year or two—you can use the business losses to offset any taxable income you have earned from other sources. Personal liability for business debts\n\nAnother crucial thing to know about operating your business as a sole proprietor is that you, as the owner of the business, can be held personally liable for business-related obligations. This means that if your business doesn’t pay a supplier, defaults on a debt, loses a lawsuit, or otherwise finds itself in financial dif- ficulty, you, personally, can be forced to pay. This can be a sobering possibility, especially if you own a house, a car, or other property. Personal liability for business obligations stems from the fundamental legal attribute of being a sole proprietor: You and your business are legally one and the same. Commercial insurance doesn’t cover business debts. While commercial insurance can protect a busi- ness\tand\tits\towners\tfrom\tsome\ttypes\tof\tliability\t(for\t instance,\tslip-and-fall\tlawsuits),\tinsurance\tnever\tcovers\n\nBest Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nbusiness debts. The only way to limit your personal liability for business debts is to use a limited liability business structure such as an LLC or a corporation. PARTNERSHIPS\n\nA partnership is a business that has more than one owner and that has not filed papers with the state to become a corporation or an LLC. While businesses with two or more owners are partnerships by default, they still must satisfy various governmental requirements for starting a business. General vs. Limited Partnerships\n\nUsually, when you hear the term “partnership,” it\n\nmeans a general partnership. General partners are personally liable for all business debts, including court judgments. In addition, each individual partner can be sued\tfor\tthe\tfull\tamount\tof\tany\tbusiness\tdebt\t(though\t that partner can turn around and sue the other part- ners\tfor\ttheir\tshare\tof\tthe\tdebt). Another\tvery\timpor- tant aspect of general partnerships is that any individ- ual partner can bind the whole business to a contract or business deal—in other words, each partner has “agency authority” for the partnership. And remember, each of the partners is fully personally liable for a busi- ness deal gone sour, no matter which partner signed the contract. So choose your partners carefully. There are also a couple of special kinds of partner- ships, called limited partnerships and limited liability partnerships. They operate under very different rules and are relatively uncommon except for professionals such as lawyers and accountants. Personal liability for business debts\n\nSince a partnership is legally inseparable from its owners, just like a sole proprietorship, general partners are personally liable for business-related obligations. What’s more, in a general partnership, the business actions of any one partner bind the other partners, who can be held personally liable for those actions. So if your business partner takes out an ill-advised high- interest loan on behalf of the partnership, makes a terrible business deal, or gets in some other business mischief without your knowledge, you could be held personally responsible for any debts that result. EXAMPLE: Tom Tumbler and Peggy Preschool are partners in a profitable gymnastics school. They’ve been in busi- ness for five years and have earned healthy profits, allowing them each to buy a house, new car, and\n\n17\n\neven a few luxuries. One day Tom, without telling Peggy, orders a brand new set of equipment he is sure will be a big boost for the girl’s team program. But when the shipment arrives, so do the big bills, at the same time enrollment takes a dip, with the result that the business runs up hefty debts. As a general partner, Peggy is personally liable for these debts even though she had nothing to do with the equipment purchase. Before you get too worried about personal liability, keep in mind that many small businesses don’t face much of a risk of racking up large debts. Insurance does not cover regular business debts, however. If you have significant personal assets like fat bank accounts or real estate and plan to rack up some business debt, you may want to limit your personal liability with a different business structure, such as an LLC or a corporation. Partnership agreements\n\nBy drafting a partnership agreement, you can struc- ture your relationship with your partners pretty much however you want. You and your partners can establish the\tshares\tof\tprofits\t(or\tlosses)\teach\tpartner\twill\treceive,\t what the responsibilities of each partner will be, what should happen to the partnership if a partner leaves, and how a number of other issues will be handled. It is not legally necessary for a partnership to have a written agreement; the simple act of two or more people doing business together creates a partnership. But only with a clear written agreement will all partners be sure of the important—and sometimes touchy—details of their business arrangement. Partnership agreements typically include at least the following information:\n\nname\tof\tpartnership\tand\tpartnership\tbusiness •\t date\tof\tpartnership\tcreation •\t purpose\tof\tpartnership •\t contributions\t(cash,\tproperty,\tand\twork)\tof\teach partner to the partnership\n\neach\tpartner’s\tshare\tof\tprofits\tand\tlosses •\t provisions\tfor\ttaking\tprofits\tout\tof\tthe\tcompany (often\tcalled\tpartners’\tdraws)\n\neach\tpartner’s\tmanagement\tpower\tand\tduties •\t how\tthe\tpartnership\twill\thandle\tdeparture\tof\ta partner, including buy-out terms\n\nprovisions\tfor\tadding\tor\texpelling\ta\tpartner •\t dispute\tresolution\tprocedures\n\nSome partnership agreements cover each topic with a sentence or two; others spend up to a few pages on each provision. Your agreement should be appropriate for that size and formality of your busi-\n\nBest Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nness, but it is not wise to hold back on your partner- ship agreement. Potential changes in ownership. A buy-sell agreement establishes rules for what will\n\nhappen if an owner retires, becomes disabled, dies, gets divorced, or otherwise faces a situation that brings business ownership into question. Buy-sell provisions can exist in a separate document or may be included in partnership agreements or other organizational docu- ments depending on the company structure: operat- ing agreements for LLCs, or bylaws for corporations. Become familiar with the ownership issues that can arise when your business is owned by more than one person—and how best to head off problems with a solid agreement. LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANIES (LLCs) Like many business owners just starting out, you might find yourself in this common quandary: On one hand, having to cope with the risk of personal liability for business misfortunes scares you; on the other, you would rather not deal with the red tape of starting and operating a corporation. Fortunately, for you and many other entrepreneurs, you can avoid these problems by taking advantage of a form of business called a limited liability company, commonly referred to as an LLC. LLCs combine the pass-through taxation of a sole proprietorship\tor\tpartnership\t(taxes\ton\tbusiness\tincome\t are\tpaid\ton\teach\towner’s\tindividual\tincome\ttax\treturns)\t with the same protection against personal liability that corporations offer. Limited personal liability\n\nGenerally speaking, owners of an LLC are not\n\npersonally liable for the LLC’s debts. This protects the owners from legal and financial liability in case their business fails, or loses a lawsuit, and can’t pay its debts. In those situations, creditors can take all of the LLC’s as- sets, but they generally can’t go after the personal as- sets of the LLC’s owners. Losing your business is tragic, but it’s a lot better to lose only what you put into the business than to say goodbye to everything you own. Keep in mind that, like a general partner in a part- nership, any member of a member-managed LLC can legally bind the entire LLC to a contract or business transaction. In other words, each member can act as an agent of the LLC. While LLC owners enjoy limited personal liability for many of their business debts, this protection is not absolute. There are several situations in which an LLC owner may become personally liable for business debts or claims. However, this drawback\n\n18\n\nis not unique to LLCs—the limited liability protection given to LLC members is just as strong as that enjoyed by the corporate shareholders of small corporations. Here are the main situations where LLC owners can still be held personally liable for debts:\n\nPersonal guarantees. If you give a personal guarantee on a loan to the LLC, then you are personally liable for repaying that loan. Since personal guarantees are often required by banks and other lenders, this is a good reason to be a conservative borrower. Of course, if no personal guarantee is made, then only the LLC—not the members—is liable for the debt. Taxes. The IRS or the state tax agency may go af- ter the personal assets of LLC owners for overdue corporate federal and state tax debts, particularly overdue payroll taxes. This is most likely to hap- pen to members of small LLCs who have an active hand in managing the business, rather than to passive members. Negligent or intentional acts. An LLC owner who intentionally or even carelessly hurts some- one will usually face personal liability. Breach of fiduciary duty. LLC owners have a le- gal duty to act in the best interest of their compa- ny and its members. This legal obligation is known as a “fiduciary duty,” or is sometimes simply called a “duty of care.” An LLC owner who violates this duty can be held personally liable for any damages that\tresult\tfrom\tthe\towner’s\tactions\t(or\tinactions). Fortunately for LLC owners, they normally will not be held personally responsible for any honest mistakes or acts of poor judgment they commit in doing their jobs. Most often, breach of duty is found only for serious indiscretions such as fraud or other illegal behavior. Blurring the boundaries between the LLC and its owners. When owners fail to respect the separate legal existence of their LLC, but instead treat it as an extension of their personal affairs, a court may ignore the existence of the LLC and rule that the owners are personally liable for business debts and liabilities. Generally, this is more likely to occur in one-member LLCs; in reality, it only hap- pens in extreme cases. You can easily avoid it by opening a separate LLC checking account, getting a federal employer identification number, keep- ing separate accounting books for your LLC, and funding your LLC adequately enough to be able to meet foreseeable expenses. Best Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nLLC Taxation\n\nLike a sole proprietorship or a partnership, an LLC is not a separate tax entity from its owners; instead, it’s what the IRS calls a “pass-through entity.” This means the LLC itself does not pay any income taxes; instead, income passes through the business to each LLC owner, who\tpays\ttaxes\ton\tthe\tshare\tof\tprofit\t(or\tdeducts\tthe\t share\tof\tlosses)\ton\tthe\towner’s\tindividual\tincome\ttax\t return\t(for\tthe\tfeds,\tForm\t1040\twith\tSchedule\tE\tat- tached). But\ta\tmulti-owned\tLLC,\tlike\ta\tpartnership,\tdoes\t have to file Form 1065—an “informational return”—to let the government know how much the business earned or lost that year. No tax is paid with this return. LLCs give members the flexibility to choose to have\n\nthe company taxed like a corporation rather than as a pass-through entity. In fact, partnerships now have this option as well. You may wonder why LLC own- ers would choose to be taxed as a corporation. After all, pass-through taxation is one of the most popular features of an LLC. The answer is that, because of the income-splitting strategy of corporations, LLC members can sometimes come out ahead by having their busi- ness taxed as a separate entity at corporate tax rates. For example, if the owners of an LLC become suc- cessful enough to keep some profits in the business at the\tend\tof\tthe\tyear\t(or\tregularly\tneed\tto\tkeep\tsignifi- cant\tprofits\tin\tthe\tbusiness\tfor\tupcoming\texpenses),\t paying tax at corporate tax rates can save them money. That’s because federal income tax rates for corpora- tions start at a lower rate than the rates for individuals. For this reason, many LLCs start out being taxed as partnerships, and when they make enough profit to justify\tkeeping\tsome\tin\tthe\tbusiness\t(rather\tthan\tpaying\t them\tout\tas\tsalaries\tand\tbonuses),\tthey\topt\tfor\tcorpo- rate-style taxation. Forming an LLC\n\nBefore you decide that an LLC is the best choice for your business, you should be aware that an LLC might not be as inexpensive to start as a partnership or sole proprietorship. To form an LLC, you must file Articles of Organization with your Secretary of State or other LLC filing office. A few states charge significant filing fees,\tplus\tannual\tdues\t(alternately\tcalled\tminimum\t taxes,\tannual\tfees,\tor\trenewal\tfees). These\tfees\tcan\t push the costs of starting an LLC into the several- hundred-dollar range. Illinois, for instance, charges a $500 filing fee, and California requires that you pay a minimum annual LLC tax of $800 when you start your LLC—on top of its $70 filing fee. Many brand-new business owners aren’t in a posi- tion to pay this kind of money right out of the start- ing gate, so they start out as partnerships until they bring in enough income to cover these costs. And if\n\n19\n\nyou’re thinking of forming a corporation instead, keep in mind that most states charge at least as much in fees for corporations. This plus the added expenses of running\ta\tcorporation\t(legal\tand\taccounting\tfees,\tfor\t example)\twill\talmost\talways\tmake\ta\tcorporation\tmore\t expensive to run than an LLC. CORPORATIONS\n\nFor many, the term “corporation” conjures up the image of a massive industrial empire more akin to a na- tion-state than a small business. In fact, a corporation doesn’t have to be huge, and most aren’t. There are two major types of corporations – “S” and regular or “C” corporations. Stripped to its essentials, a corpora- tion is simply a specific legal structure that imposes certain\tlegal\tand\ttax\trules\ton\tits\towners\t(also\tcalled\t shareholders). A\tcorporation\tcan\tbe\tas\tlarge\tas\tIBM\t or, in many cases, as small as one person. One funda- mental legal characteristic of a corporation is that it’s a separate legal entity from its owners. Another impor- tant corporate feature is that shareholders are normally protected from personal liability for business debts. Finally, the corporation itself—not just the sharehold- ers—are subject to income tax. Forming a corporation to shield yourself from per- sonal liability for business obligations provides good, but not complete, protection for your personal assets. Privately held corporations owned by a small group of people who are actively involved in running the busi- ness are much easier to manage than public corpora- tions, whose shares are sold to the public at large. Any corporation that sells its stock to the general public is heavily regulated by state and federal securities laws, while corporations that sell shares, without advertis- ing, only to a select group of people who meet specific state requirements are often exempt from many of these laws. If you plan to sell shares of a corporation to the general public, you should consult a lawyer. LLCs vs. Corporations\n\nBefore LLCs came along, the only way all owners of a business could get limited personal liability was to form a corporation. Many entrepreneurs didn’t want the hassle and expense of incorporating, not to mention the headache of dealing with corporate taxation. One easier option was to form a special type of corpora- tion known as an S corporation, which is like a normal corporation in most respects, except that business profits pass through to the owner, rather than being taxed to the corporation at corporate tax rates. In other words, S corporations offered the limited liability of a corporation with the pass-through taxation of a sole\n\nBest Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nproprietorship or partnership. For a long time, this was an okay compromise for small-to-medium sized busi- nesses, though they still had to deal with many of the corporate aspects that S corporations retained. Now, however, LLCs offer a better option. LLCs are similar to S corporations in that they combine limited personal liability with pass-through tax status. But a significant difference between these two types of businesses is that LLCs are not bound by the many regulations that govern S corporations. Here is an overview of the major areas of difference\n\nbetween S corporations and LLCs:\n\nOwnership restrictions. An S corporation may not have more than 75 shareholders, all of whom must be U.S. citizens or residents. This means that some of the C corporation’s main benefits— namely, the ability to set up stock option and bo- nus plans and to bring in public capital—are pretty much out of the question for S corporations. And even if an S corporation initially meets the U.S. citizen or resident requirement, its shareholders can’t\tsell\tshares\tto\tanother\tcompany\t(like\ta\tcorpo- ration\tor\tan\tLLC)\tor\ta\tforeign\tcitizen,\ton\tthe\trisk\t of losing S corporation tax status. In an LLC, any type of person or entity can become a member—a U.S. citizen, a citizen of a foreign country, another LLC, a corporation, or a limited partnership. Allocation of profits and losses. Shareholders of an S corporation must allocate profits accord- ing to the percentage of stock each owner has. For example, a 25% owner has to receive 25% of\tthe\tprofits\t(or\tlosses),\teven\tif\tthe\tother\towners\t want a different division. Owners of an LLC, on the\tother\thand,\tmay\tdistribute\tprofits\t(and\tthe\ttax\t burden\tthat\tgoes\twith\tthem)\thowever\tthey\tsee\tfit,\t without regard to each member’s ownership share in the company. For instance, a member of an LLC who owns 25% of the business can receive 50% of\tthe\tprofits\tif\tthe\tother\tmembers\tagree\t(subject\t to\ta\tfew\tIRS\trules). Corporate meeting and record-keeping rules. For S corporation shareholders to keep their limited liability protection, they have to follow the corporate rules: issuing stock, electing officers, holding regular board of directors’ and sharehold- ers’ meetings, keeping corporate minutes of all meetings, and following the mandatory rules found in their state’s corporation code. By con- trast, LLC owners don’t need to jump through most of these legal hoops—they just have to make sure their management team is in agreement on major decisions and go about their business. 20\n\nTax treatment of losses. S corporation share- holders are at a disadvantage if their company goes into substantial debt—for instance, if it borrows money to open the business or buy real estate. That’s because an S corporation’s business debt cannot be passed along to its shareholders unless they have personally cosigned and guar- anteed the debt. LLC owners, on the other hand, normally can reap the tax benefits of any business debt, cosigned or not. This can translate into a nice tax break for owners of LLCs that carry debt. Forming and running a corporation\n\nIn addition to tax complexity, a major drawback to\n\nforming a corporation—either a C or an S type—is time and expense. To incorporate, you must file Articles of Incorporation with your Secretary of State or other corporate filing office, along with often significent fil- ing fees and minimum annual taxes. And if you decide to sell shares of the corporation to the public—as opposed to keeping them in the hands of a relatively small number of owners—you’ll have to comply with lots of complex federal and state securities laws. Fi- nally, to protect your limited personal liability, you need to act like a corporation, which means adopting by- laws, issuing stock to shareholders, maintaining records of various meetings of directors and shareholders, and keeping records and transactions of the business sepa- rate from those of the owners. The protection afforded by incorporating comes at a price. Figure in the costs to hire lawyers, accountants, and other professionals to keep your corporation in compliance, and it’s easy to see how expensive running a corporation can be. Corporate taxation\n\nIf you decide to incorporate, you’ll likely want to consult an accountant or small business lawyer who can fill you in on the fine print. The first thing you need to know is that you’ll be treated differently for tax purposes depending on whether you operate as a C corporation or you elect S corporation status for tax purposes. An S corporation is the same as a C corpora- tion in most respects, but when it comes to taxes, C and S corporations are very different. A regular, or C, corporation must pay taxes, while an S corporation is treated like a partnership for tax purposes and doesn’t pay any income taxes itself. Like partnership profits, S\tcorporation\tprofits\t(and\tlosses)\tpass\tthrough\tto\tthe\t shareholders, who report them on their individual returns. In this respect, S corporations are very similar to LLCs, which also offer limited liability along with partnership-style tax treatment. Best Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nFringe benefits and perks\n\nLike employee salaries, corporations can deduct many fringe benefits as business expenses. If a corpo- ration pays for benefits such as health and disability insurance for its employees and owner/ employees, the cost can usually be deducted from the corporate income, reducing a possible tax bill. As a general rule, owners of sole proprietorships, partnerships, and LLCs can deduct the cost of provid- ing these benefits for employees, but not for them- selves. The fact that fringe benefits for owners are deductible for corporations may make incorporating a wise choice. But it’s less likely to be a good strategy for a capital-poor start-up that can’t afford to sup- port a benefits package. Double taxation\n\nThis brings us to the problem of double taxation, routinely faced by larger corporations with sharehold- ers who aren’t active employees. Unlike salaries and bonuses, dividends paid to shareholders cannot be deducted as business expenses from corporate earn- ings. Since they’re not deducted, any amounts paid as dividends are included in the total corporate profit and taxed. And when the shareholder receives the dividend, it is taxed at the shareholder’s individual tax rate as part of personal income. Any money paid out as a dividend gets taxed twice: once at the corporate level, and once at the individual level. Double taxation can be avoided simply by not pay- ing dividends. This is usually easy if all shareholders are employees, but probably more difficult if some shareholders are passive investors anxious for a rea- sonable return on their investments. CHOOSING THE BEST STRUCTURE FOR YOUR BUSINESS\n\nAlthough there are many differences among the various types of business organizations, most busi- ness owners choose an operating structure based on one legal issue: the personal liability of owners for business debts. While the issue of personal liability can have a huge impact on successful small business- es a few years down the road, business owners who are just starting out on a shoestring often care most about spending as little money as possible on the legal structure of their business. This is certainly an understandable approach: Far more new businesses die painful deaths because they don’t control costs than because they lose costly lawsuits. In short, for many new small businesses, incorporating or organiz-\n\n21\n\ning as an LLC is as unnecessary an expense as a swank downtown office or a gleaming chrome espresso machine in the lunchroom. That said, owners of any business that will engage in a high-risk activity, rack up large business debts, or have a significant number of investors should always insist on limited personal liability, either with an LLC or a corporation. This is even more true if the business can’t find or afford appropriate insurance. If you decide that limiting your personal liability is worth the extra cost, you still need to decide whether to form a corporation or an LLC. With the LLC’s arrival, many business owners who want limited liability pro- tection realize that incorporation normally only makes sense if a business needs to take advantage of the corporate stock structure to attract key employees and investment capital. No question, corporations may have an easier time attracting capital investment by issuing stock privately or publicly. And some businesses may find it easier to attract and retain key employees by issuing employee stock options. But for businesses that never go public, choosing to operate as LLCs rather than corporations normally makes the most sense, if limited liability is the main concern. If the corporate stock structure isn’t something you want or need for your business, the simplicity and flexibility of LLCs offer a clear advantage over corporations. Analyzing Your Risks\n\nStarting a business is always risky. In the gymnastics businesses, however, the risks are particularly extreme. If you’re planning to launch into this endeavor, there is little doubt that you’ll need all the protection you can get, including limited personal liability as well as adequate insurance. Other businesses are not so obvi- ously risk-loaded, but the gymnastics business carries multiple red flags for risk including caring for children, conducting activities that may result in injury, and pos- sibly driving as part of the job, the use of heavy equip- ment, and using hazardous materials, such as cleaning solvents. If you’ve identified one or more serious risks your business is likely to face, figure out whether business insurance might give you enough protection. Some risky activities are good candidates for insurance and don’t necessarily warrant incorporating. But if insur- ance can’t cover all of the risks involved in your busi- ness, it may be time to form an LLC or a corporation. Keep in mind that insurance will never insulate you from regular business debts. If you foresee your busi- ness going into serious debt, an LLC or corporation may be the best business structure for you. Best Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nGovernment requirements\n\nYou may feel ready to just open the doors and begin\n\nclasses but there is a lot of truth in the axiom that no job is finished until the paperwork is done. Government regulations must be followed or your new business is at risk of not seeing a second season. There are a number of steps to take to meet government requirements:\n\nincludes general sales of retail products. This regulation allows the state to collect sales tax on tangible goods sold by the retailer. If you plan to operate a pro shop or sell items to the public, check with the state sales tax agency for information. Depending\ton\tthe\tlegal\tbusiness\tstructure,\tyou\tmay\t need to apply for a Federal Employer Identification Number\t(FEIN)\tby\tfilling\tout\tthe\trequired\tform. If\tyour\tbusiness\tdoes\tnot\tcontain\tyour\tname\tor match your LLC name, you will need to file for a Fictitious\tBusiness\tName\t(FBN)\tand\tregister\tas\tan\t assumed\tname\tDoing\tBusiness\tAs\t(DBA). Depend- ing on your location, this may be accomplished at the state level or with the county clerk where the business is located. A\tbusiness\tlicense\tand\tlocal\ttax\tregistration\tis\tre- quired in most cities. Contact your city clerk or city business office for the necessary forms. Depend- ing on the location of your business, these same regulations may hold true at the county level. Most\tstates\trequire\tseller’s\tpermits\tif\tthe\tbusiness\n\nMake\tsure\tthat\tyou\tcomply\twith\tlocal\tregula- tions pertaining to planning and zoning. Addi- tional permits and licenses may be required but almost every city will require a use permit that will regulate hours of operation, parking, traffic, environmental impacts, signs, etc. Certain uses will require conditional use permits and vari- ances. Again, check with your local planning department or zoning agency for details. The message here is don’t let yourself get caught up in an oversight or poor planning when it comes to your business structure or government regulations. Stepping through the bureaucracy is not fun but is time well spent. It is a good idea to find an attorney and/or an accountant to help guide you through the process, but don’t let the red tape keep you from at least looking into your options.

Developing a business plan forces you to put your goals and ideas in writing. The process demonstrates your dedication to your business and clarifies your thoughts about what you wish to accomplish. When your plan is on paper, you have a guide to check on a regular basis to see if you and your business are on track. A business plan also gives potential investors and key employees an understanding of where the business is headed. When you approach a bank or other investment group for financing, you will definitely need a detailed business plan. There are many excellent books and articles that describe the process of writing a business plan. Visit any office supply or computer store to get an idea of the many software packages available that can help you construct your plan. A word of caution, however, regarding such “plan-in-a-can” programs; a well-writ- ten business plan must reflect your soul, your desire, and your determination to reach your vision - not some fill-in-the-blank template. After writing your business plan using a pack aged program, re-read it and re-write it to reflect your vision for your business. There are dozens of books and software packages that can teach you all about creating a business plan. In almost all cases these resources focus on the creation of a document called a “Business Plan” that you can present to a bank or other lending institution in order to obtain financing for your new business. In addition, the process of creating this “business plan” can help you attend to details that you might otherwise skim over or miss entirely. It would certainly be helpful to consult one or more\n\nof these books or software programs and work your way through the steps they suggest whether you need to obtain financing or not. More importantly, you need to spend some time\n\n23\n\nBusiness PlanninG\n\nplanning for your business. A formal “business plan” is but one part of the process of planning for your busi- ness. There is much more to it than that. Your plan for opening and operating a gymnastics business must include the development of a business owner’s skill set. It would be great if you were to get a degree in marketing, an MBA, a law degree, with accounting, bookkeeping, finance, and advertising thrown in for best results. If you were to set out to do all of this you would find yourself working about as hard as an elite gymnast and after 10-15 years or so you would be ready to have a go at opening a gym. You might even be successful."

        "But there are other approaches that might be a bit\n\nmore practical. The fact that you are reading this publication is a great start. The information and advice you find here is offered by those who have been there and who have lived to tell the tale. However, this book is but a first step."

        "See the Resource List in the Appendix for other sources of information. The very first step and one you should have taken long before you started reading this publication is to work in a gymnastics business. If you are working in a school or a community recreation center or a YMCA you really should spend some time working for an organization that has to make a profit. The mind set is different. Try your hand at many different positions within the gym. Teach and coach everything the gym offers and then step up and volunteer to organize and launch a new program. This is what owning a gym is all about. If the gym in which you are working is not a particu- larly successful gym financially, then consider working for one that is. If you cannot work in a financially suc- cessful gym then at least visit one and take a very close look around. How can you tell if a gym is successful financially? Look around. Is the gym clean, is it air-conditioned, is the landscaping nice, are the mats torn, is there some-\n\nBest Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\none on hand to answer the phone 12 hours a day, does the staff wear uniforms, is the gym busy all the time, is the parking lot big and full of cars, and so on? One of my early mentors told me that “Customers will not come to your gym because the bathrooms are clean and well stocked, but they will stop coming if they are not.” Words of wisdom that hold true after thirty years. Make note of what works and what does not work. What does this gym do well that I can copy or adopt? What are the shortcomings and how can I improve upon them? Start thinking like a gym owner."

        "After a while this way of thinking will become sec- ond nature. Once you feel a real desire to open a gym- nastics business that is something special and that can offer a real benefit to the children and families in the community then you are probably ready to get serious about opening a gym of your own and you will be well into developing your plan for your gymnastics business. OUTLINE OF A BUSINESS PLAN\n\nWhile there are a number of acceptable formats and styles of business plans, each plan contains certain information that is imperative to a successful proposal. The following is an outline for a typical business plan:\n\nCover Sheet / Introduction\n\nServices/Product\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nBusiness\tconcept •\t Current\tstatus •\t Performance\tmeasures •\t Financial\tneeds\n\nVision\n\nVision/Mission\tstatement •\t Business\tmilestones\n\nDescription\tof\tservice/product •\t Comparative\tevaluation\tof\tservice/product •\t Future\tservices/products\n\nMarketing\n\nBranding\tstrategy •\t Marketing\tstrategy •\t Advertising •\t Publicity •\t Promotions\n\nMarket Analysis\n\nOperations\n\nOverall\tmarket\tsynopsis •\t Market\ttrends •\t Target\tmarket\tand\tcustomers •\t Customer\tcharacteristics\n\nStaffing\tplan •\t Organizational\tstructure •\t Facilities\tplan •\t Programming\tplan •\t Customer\tservice\tplan\n\nCompetitive Analysis\n\nIndustry\toverview •\t Industry\ttrends •\t Competitive\tbreakdown •\t Opportunities •\t Challenges\tand\trisks\n\nStrategy\n\nStrategic\tplan •\t Strategic\taction\tplan\n\nFinancials\n\nStart-up\tcost\testimate •\t Starting\tbalance\tsheet •\t Profit\t/\tLoss\tforecast •\t Cash\tflow\tprojection •\t Break\teven\tanalysis •\t Balance\tsheet •\t Analysis\n\n24\n\nBest Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nThe\tSmall\tBusiness\tAdministration\t(SBA)\thas\tmany\tre- sources for anyone ready to explore starting a business, including the important task of writing a business plan. Putting a plan on paper forces you to think through important issues your business will face. The plan becomes a valuable tool as you set out to\n\nraise money or seek technical assistance, and it pro- vides milestones to gauge your success. The SBA advises that a plan contain details about what the business will do, marketing, financing and management. The plan should include an executive summary and supporting documents, such as tax returns, personal financial statements and resumes of the principals, cop- ies of any proposed lease or purchase agreement for building space, copies of licenses and other legal docu- ments; and if it’s a franchise, a copy of the franchise agreement.

FIND A NICHE FOR YOUR BUSINESS An important step in the development of your business is to state your purpose or goal in writing, otherwise known as your Mission Statement. A Mission Statement reflects your reason for existing as well as your goal for your business. 25\n\nFor example, USA Gymnastics’ Mission Statement is\n\nas follows:\n\n“The mission of USA Gymnastics is to encourage participation and to pursue excellence in all aspects of gymnastics.”\n\nAlthough writing a mission statement might not seem very important at first, you will be surprised at how much it can help you along the way as you are making decisions about pro gram, policies and market- ing. A well thought-out mission statement can be your guiding light for years to come! It also tells potential investors and customers what you are all about in a simple, concise statement. Writing your mission statement is an important step toward creating your business’ niche. You might com- pete head-to-head with existing programs or create a new approach within the community. If you choose to compete head-to-head with existing gyms, seek a way to differ entiate your business from established pro- grams. There are successful schools that approach gymnas-\n\ntics from very different viewpoints. The most critical issue at work here is that each school is a reflection of the desires, strengths, abili ties, and personalities of its owners. The following chapters of this booklet address issues any gymnastics school must face. Your answers to the questions posed should reflect not only what you think the community wants, but also your personal goals and aspirations. You need to make an honest assessment of how hard you are willing to work, as well as your ability to manage people. Gather as much information as you can by talking to other gym school owners and by attending busi ness seminars offered at USA Gymnas- tics National, Regional or State Congresses. Consider contacting a gym consultant to discuss various issues or plan to attend a workshop specifically designed for gym owners.

        "In marketing, the perception of need is much more important than the need itself. This is especially true when selling a service. A service business succeeds be- cause the owner has convinced the customer base that he or she is providing a valuable service.

A common practice that draws customers during the start-up phase is under-pric- ing the competition. When offering low introduc- tory prices, the discounts must be budgeted as normal business operating costs. For example, a 10% discount on $5,000 should be budgeted as a $500 cost.

        "Circumstances can cre- ate company-killing situations. There is always the possibility of a downturn in economic conditions or an \"act of God\" such as a flood or earthquake. Prepare yourself as best as possible for emergency situations. 26\n\nBest Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nPoor understanding of business. If you lack expertise in any of the following areas, you will soon get an education or go out of business:\n\n– How to collect money – How to close sales – Purchasing – Negotiating – Government regulations – Taxes – Hiring and firing – Motivating employees – Securing financing\n\nProblem location. The location of your business could be great but overburden you with too high a rent, or have a low rent but be situated too far from\tyour\tcustomer\tbase. The\tarea's\tcustomer\t demographics can change, leaving you with a less desirable location. Poor accounting controls. The sales journal and cash receipts must be reconciled on a daily basis. Without controls, you could lose track of custom- ers and not receive payment, or even double bill a customer. By monitoring your payables, you can prevent double paying a bill or not paying a lost bill. You also need to protect tax withholdings so that the money is there when it comes time to pay the IRS. Invest in a good business accounting software program that matches your ability to understand the basics of accounting. Then hire someone to help set you up, if needed, and use the software diligently. Perhaps the most critical mistake a new business owner makes is not starting out with sufficient fund- ing. A good rule of thumb is to have enough resources to make it through one full year of operation. At a minimum, ensure enough capital to keep the doors open for three to four months without additional cash flow. There are a lot of sources available where new business owners can look for funding. Personal savings, loans from family and friends, small business loans, home equity lines of credit, personal bank loans and angel investors are all typical solutions to start-up capital and business funding. How much money does it take?"

        "Let’s go back to the automobile analogy. General costs for a car varies depending upon what kind of car you want - Ford, Porsche, Volkswagen, Chevy, or Ferrari? The same is true for gymnastics training facili- ties. Start-up costs can range from tens of thousands to millions of dollars. A lot depends on the size of the\n\n27\n\ngym, geographic location, and type of facility. Mainte- nance fees and insurance are usually directly related to those same factors. Then you need to equip the gym; the larger the facility, the more apparatus you will need and the more it will cost. There is also liability insurance based on the number of students. The business plan created for the business will iden- tify all of the initial start-up costs and include cash flow projections, break-even analysis, balance sheets, and profit/loss projections. This information included in the business plan will be shared with a finance officer who will guide you through the loan process. What lenders want to see in a loan proposal After your business plan is written, a well-crafted loan proposal is your next step if you’re seeking fund- ing from a bank or other lender. A loan proposal must answer:\n\nWho\tare\tyou? •\t How\tmuch\tmoney\tdo\tyou\tneed? •\t How\tare\tyou\tgoing\tto\trepay\tthe\tloan? •\t What\thappens\tif\tyou\tcan’t\trepay\tit? The\tSmall\tBusiness\tAdministration\t(SBA)\tadvises\tthat\n\na loan proposal contain:\n\nA summary. This should be clear, concise, ac- curate and inviting. Summarize how the loan will be used and repaid. Top management profiles. You will need resumes, a summary of experience, and the qualifications and credentials for owners and key members of the organization. Business description. Include a brief overview of the history and a summary of current activi- ties. Demonstrate that you understand your field. It is also helpful to include letters from suppliers, customers and other business references. Projections. Include projected income and cash-flow statements for two to three years. Your assumptions should be clearly stated and realistic. Financial statements. Include business and personal financial statements. Make sure you understand the “story” that your financial state- ments tell. Purpose of the loan. Present a detailed state- ment of how you will use the loan proceeds. Include proceeds of the loan in your cash-flow projections\t(and\tthe\tinterest\tin\tthe\tprojected\t income\tstatement). Best Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nAmount. When determining the amount, ask, “How much money do I need, and how much will they lend?” and not, “Will they lend it?”\n\nRepayment plans. In the first package, you will propose the terms you want, but ultimately this will be a point that will be negotiated with the bank. SBA programs\n\nBelow are some of the loan programs offered by the SBA. For a complete list and details on how to apply, visit www.sba.gov. 7(a) Loans: The primary SBA loan program helps small businesses that might not be eligible for loans through normal lending channels. Money can be used for a variety of business purposes. The loans are made through commercial lenders and partially backed by an SBA guaranty. CDC 504 Loans: Made through a certified devel- opment company, a 504 loan provides long-term, fixed-rate financing for real estate, machinery or equipment. Typically, the loan involves a private- sector lender with a senior lien, a certified devel- opment company and at least 10 percent equity from the borrower. Microloans: Provide short-term loans of up to $35,000 for working capital or purchases, but can’t be used for real estate. The loan is through a nonprofit community based lender. The typical microloan size is about $13,700. Establishing fees for your services\n\nAs to cost per lesson, this fee varies on length of les- son, class level, market, and program. Again, thinking of a car, costs to operate depend on what kind of car you have – Prius, Hummer, Mini, or minivan. Class fees can\trange\tanywhere\tfrom\tfree\t(subsidized\tnon-profit\t programs)\tto\thundreds\tof\tdollars\tper\thour\t(private\tles- sons). A positive situation with gymnastics businesses is the fact that almost all gym owners collect fees for services before those services are provided. This can work to a gym owner’s advantage in that there is no guesswork\n\n28\n\non how many classes need to be offered, how many staff to schedule, etc. This also creates a cash flow situ- ation that demands constant attention so that there is enough money left over each month to pay expenses. Even though income is received up front, the gym still has the liability of performing the services. The disad- vantage comes if the owner ever decides to close the doors and needs to refund any fees collected. So how much should you charge? Performing a fee survey of the other gyms in the area to see what they are charging is a great place to start but that will only give you an idea of the current market. The more investigation and market analysis you do, the more information you will have to help you make important decisions. Understanding what your competitors charge gives you a standard to work from but should not be the primary basis of your assessment of what to charge. Going back to your business plan, calculating how much money you will need to charge in order to con- duct business, you will find a minimum amount you will need to recover all of your expenses. Your busi- ness\tplan\twill\thave\tidentified\tyour\tfixed\tcosts\t(rent\tor\t lease payments, utilities, payroll, taxes, and operating expenses)\tthat\twill\tremain\tconstant.

Another decision you will need to make is the stu- dent: teacher ratio you will use for each level of class. Remember that there are fixed costs associated with your business and it will cost you the same amount to run a class with one student as it does to run a class with ten students. Maintaining full classes is a great way to improve your bottom line. There is a lot of debate over cost recovery rates and how often and how much to raise fees. This is a business philosophy question that has proponents on every side – charge premium rates and work the top percentage based on high quality, go for the low fee model and work for high enrollment based on price, or take the value-added route and sell your service based on comparison to your competitors, and everything in between. Finally, there is typically a tremendous seasonal vari- ance in revenues."

The desire to build a better mouse trap and/or dissatisfaction with exist- ing programs seem to be common reasons for opening new gymnastics schools. Many coaches feel the need to exercise their own creativity and have more control over the direction of their training program. Over the past two decades, the gymnastics industry\n\nhas grown tremendously. What was once a cottage industry run largely by former athletes as a second job or a hobby has become a big industry where gym own- ers are seeking to earn a comfortable income from a primary business. Most gymnastics schools are owned by people who are passionate about gymnastics and who have chalk dust coursing through their lungs if not their veins. In many cases gymnastic businesses are opened by those who have had some success as gymnastics coaches or teachers. This is absolutely normal. But is it enough? 30\n\noPeratinG a Gymnastics Business\n\nAn analogy is in order. Is it reasonable to suggest\n\nthat a level 10 female gymnast who has trained twenty hours a week on vault, bars, beam, and floor should also be an expert on the pommel horse? How about a NCAA ring specialist? Should he be able to perform at a high level on balance beam? Of course not; it is all gymnastics but the skill sets do not transfer. Is it reasonable to suggest that a terrific gymnas- tics coach, a coach whose gymnasts have won many state titles and who has sent several gymnasts to Nationals, should be able to open, run, and man- age a gymnastics business? Of course not; it is all gymnastics but the skill sets do not transfer. Actually, it is not all gymnastics. Operating a business is one thing while coaching gymnastics is another. The fundamental goal of a gymnastics busi- ness is to make a profit and the means to make that profit is through teaching gymnastics. Two things; Two skill sets. Best Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nCHAPTER FIvE\n\nHIRING STAFF\n\nThe heart of any great organization is the people in that organization. Everything begins with the staff. After an extensive hiring process, there is a reason that Disney spends five complete days training their employ- ees before allowing them to meet the public. The staff that the client sees and deals with on a regular basis is the most important reflection of your business. Disney recognizes that the maintenance worker that walks around the park sweeping and picking up litter is the most visible front line employee and the one that needs to know everything about dealing with customers, and trains them accordingly. Hiring the proper and correct staff is critical to a successful gymnastics organization. Staff should be a reflection of what you want your organization to look like. Your employees need to have similar goals and objectives to you."

        "Surrounding yourself with people who share your vision will create a productive and vital organization. Jeff Metzger of Kids First in Cincinnati, OH refers to part of this process as the “hiring man- tra.” It requires patience and discipline but sometimes the wisest hiring decision is the decision NOT to hire. Hiring the wrong person is always trouble. Hiring the right person saves everyone a lot of time and effort in the long run. Your staff will have a number of responsibilities and in return will enjoy numerous benefits. You must expect them to act in a professional manner. Hold them ac- countable for their actions and behavior and in return you must treat them as a professional. You must also remember that they represent your organization and they will be asked to respond appropriately to many different situations. Hiring the right person is one of the most important decisions a gym owner can make. Employment principles\n\nSome refer to them as value statements, but best practices dictate that employment principles such as\n\n31\n\nPersonnel and human resources\n\nthese are created for any organization. Use them to help find the right people to hire and hold them ac- countable for adhering to these principles. Oftentimes gymnastics business owners hire the coach with the most skill and background in gymnastics; these people may have the skills of the job but not the personality and character needed to represent your organization or help you attain your business goals. The key is to hire the personality and train that personality with the skills of the job. A good staff will be an effective and efficient team working together toward a common objective. Honesty – The hallmark of character, honesty is the core principle of any employment. Respect – Respect must be unconditional. Never allow a staff member to talk down to a parent or a child or a co-worker. Open Communication – No matter what the situation; happy parents, unhappy kids, com- placent staff – the key is communication. Early communication; don’t wait for big problems; com- municate\tobservations\t(not\topinions)\toften. Be\ta\t good listener that strives to understand. Focus the communication on the issue; engage in “critical conversations.”\n\nTeamwork – Working together toward a com- mon goal defines a team. Every member of your team should be expected to contribute to the success of your mission. Growth – Expand personal horizons; continue education constantly; never stop learning. Mission – Staff should be expected to create a personal mission statement themselves and then have the integrity to follow it. It should be your intent as the employer to hire individuals whose mission in life will help you reach your vision. Best Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nOrganizational leadership\n\nManagement studies have shown that supervisors spend more than 85% of their time on people issues and less that 15% of their day on the technical aspects of their jobs. Wouldn’t we all like to have an organiza- tion filled with effective staff that worked together toward higher performance? An organization where people not only saw a job to be done and did it but continually searched out for ways to improve opera- tions? We are all looking for an organization filled with leaders. The Harvard School of Business has identified 5 stages of leadership; those who have no leadership skills and only follow leaders, those who lead them- selves, leaders of small groups, leaders of large groups, and those who develop leadership skills in others. It may be tempting to try and surround yourself with the first group of people who only follow your lead. Is that what you are really looking for? An organization where every direction has to come through you and no deci- sions made or action is taken without your approval? Employees should take responsibility for certain daily\n\ntasks including refund requests, scheduling decisions, and operational situations to allow owners to work on the vision and action plans for their programs. So how do you create leaders that can make good decisions and act with responsibility? True leaders have learned not to confuse activity with\n\nproductivity. Good leaders not only have developed the organizational and technical skills to be successful at what they do but also the skills to deal with many personalities to get the most out of the people around them. Great leaders realize they can’t do everything themselves; that they can do more with the help of others. Most importantly, they not only lead, they de- velop leadership in others. Animals behave in set patterns, which is why we are able to track and hunt them. Only man has the capac- ity to consciously alter his behavior to overcome routine and habit. Most people do not exercise this power. Many people prefer the comforts of routine, giving in to our nature that makes us repeat the same compul- sive actions over and over again. It requires very little thought or effort and it is easier to maintain the status quo and not be bothered. Not everyone is a born leader but anyone can\n\nbecome a leader. It is not easy for everyone to step out- side their regular patterns of behavior and take charge. There are four reasons for people to change; out of fear, out of pain, out of love or out of intent to improve their position. Understanding that, you could threaten your employees to become leaders or you can encour- age them to develop skills by rewarding them. The best organizations are filled with leaders who share a vision\n\n32\n\n– and love what they do. The challenge is to surround yourself with people who love what they do enough to want to raise up to a leadership role. The organization’s leader then must enable and encourage decision-mak- ing, problem solving and autonomy. To create an organization full of leaders, you must begin by being a strong leader yourself. Avoid being distracted by the minutia of life."

        "Becoming buried in the detail is a sure-fire way of missing the point. There’s a need to focus on the more important strategic issues, let the front-line worker gain the necessary knowledge and competence to develop the skills to fulfill a more rounded role, and deal with the detail. A strong leader will create a shared vision. Have a mission and let everyone around you know what that mission is. Know what you want to accom- plish and develop a plan to reach those goals. Make sure the objectives are reasonably obtainable. Develop an action plan that is specific with standards that sup- port the goals and expectations. Once you can articu- late your vision, you can find people who have a similar mission and can help you reach your goals. Gym owners typically do know how their business works best, the mechanics of the way things get done, what will work and why some things fail. Spread the knowledge!"

        "S. Department of Justice, about\n\n25 percent of prisoners who victimized children had prior convictions for violent crimes; on average, pe- dophiles victimize 117 children in their lifetime before being caught; between 2 and 5 percent of teachers sexually abuse or harass students. It is reported that a child is sexually abused every six seconds. Three of four child victims of violence are female; more than half of the violent crimes committed against children involved victims under the age of 12. Just\tlike\twhy\tbank\trobbers\trob\tbanks\t-\t(“That’s\twhere\t the\tmoney\tis.”\tWilly\tSutton),\tsexual\tpredators,\tabusers,\t pedophiles and other deviants will be attracted to gym- nastics programs – because that’s where the kids are. To protect the children in your programs and to reduce your risk, criminal background checks should be con- ducted for all employees that come into contact with your students. Teachers, coaches, directors, office staff and even volunteers should be subjected to checks. When you go to the shop to have your hair cut, the\n\nperson that cuts your hair has been certified. If you have any re-modeling or building done at your gym or at home, the contractor is usually licensed and bonded. When you take your child to a day care center, that center is typically licensed and accredited. Your accoun- tant is certified, your children’s teacher is credentialed your doctor is licensed - what about your gymnastics coaches? How can the gymnastics industry stand by without creating standards for the people who coach and teach our youth? We owe society an environment that follows best practices in making sure the children in our care are as safe and secure as possible. If we don’t begin to monitor our industry and develop some standards on the qualifications and requirements of the people we employ, the legislators may do it for us. A few years back, Sports Illustrated published an ar- ticle about “Who is Coaching Our Children?” That ar- ticle brought forth example after example of individuals who were working with children and should have been discovered as non-desirable long before they were al- lowed contact with youth. The question remains; who is coaching your children? There are three recognized background checks advised: criminal background check with the Department of Justice, criminal background check with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and a Child Abuse Central Index Check. Services such as the\n\n33\n\nNational\tCenter\tfor\tSafety\tInitiatives\t(NCSI)\tare\tavailable\t to conduct background checks of individuals; check for services in your area. There is a cost involved for investigating the background of a potential employee but weigh that cost against the cost of a lawsuit or the damage done to your reputation if you were to hire the wrong person. You can be proud of the benefits you provide the children and families in your program. You work hard to keep your business running; finding and keeping good employees is one of the toughest parts of running a business. You have probably heard other people tell you that it is better to be understaffed than to be poorly staffed – do not hire the wrong people! On a somewhat lighter note but a matter that is just as important is the health screening of staff. All employees\tthat\thave\tcontact\twith\tchildren\t(HHMM,\t sounds\tlike\teveryone\tin\tthe\tgym!)\tare\tencouraged\t to be tested for tuberculosis. A simple TB test can be performed in your doctor’s office or local clinic, takes only a few minutes and is an easy best practice to fol- low. Herpes simplex, hepatitis, conjunctivitis, impetigo, meningitis - making sure that your staff is not respon- sible for spreading communicable disease is a responsi- bility to be taken seriously. In the event of an exposure, do the right thing and communicate that exposure to your clientele’ – every school sends home notices of lice outbreaks, it is not unreasonable for your gym to be exposed as well. You owe it to your customers to be responsible and respond appropriately. Make sure your employees represent your busi- ness as you would like the community to view it. For example: if you are promoting your gym as a solution for the obesity epidemic and you have overweight and unhealthy coaches on the floor, you have a credibility problem. Be sure that your employees are not a liability to your organization and follow safety practices in hir- ing new staff. You also have a responsibility to provide a safe environment for all of the employees."

        "Included in the Appendix are sample Anti-Harassment Policy, Violence Prevention Policy, and Workplace Policy documents for you to consider. USA Gymnastics Background Check\n\nUSA Gymnastics is a youth sports organization, and gymnastics is one of the country’s most popular sports, especially for girls and young women. Providing a safe, clean, and fun environment is important for the sport to continue to grow and thrive. Parents must have the highest degree of confidence that their children are not only receiving good care and proper instruction, but also are safe from negative and improper conduct. These basic tenets are crucial to maintaining a posi- tive image in the community and a good reputation,\n\nBest Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nboth in local communities and as an activity nation- wide, especially since 98 percent of our athlete mem- bers are under 18 years of age. Professional membership in USA Gymnastics should be the gold standard, an indicator that the person or organization has committed the time, interest and hard work into being the best they can be. This membership should be a distinction that parents look for and de- pend upon to know that they are placing their children into well trained and professional hands. The responsibilities of an organization that provides activities for children and young adults include protect- ing the safety and welfare of its athletes and partici- pants. USA Gymnastics has already mandated a safety certification program, which provides professional members with a working knowledge of how to con- duct gymnastics activities in a safe environment. Also, USA Gymnastics has a zero-tolerance policy on abuse and other inappropriate behavior with an athlete. USA Gymnastics requires background screening for all Pro- fessional Members to support this policy. Background checks are becoming commonplace with many youth organizations and institutions and are endorsed by the U.S. Olympic Committee. USA Gymnastics began requiring background checks for all Professional Members, including staff and Board Members, in December of 2007. As a pilot program, the USA Gymnastics Board of Directors and staff already have completed background checks with our partner,\tthe\tNational\tCenter\tfor\tSafety\tInitiatives\t(NCSI). Through NCSI, all professional members will have the endorsement of completing a successful background check for previous criminal behavior which may be in- appropriate for contact with children. Screening covers criminal background, sex offender registry and identity verification. USA Gymnastics has worked hard with NCSI to de- velop a program that is affordable, and the fees cover the costs for this service. This is not a profit center for USA Gymnastics. The monies go to and remain with NCSI. This is going to be a major undertaking for USA Gymnastics, but this initiative is an important part of providing a safe environment for our athletes, which is the responsibility of every member. USA Gymnastics is proud to announce a working partnership with National Center for Safety Initiatives through which we will engage in a comprehensive background screening program. USA Gymnastics is requiring background searches on all USA Gymnastics Professional Members to ensure a safe and secure envi- ronment for participants and it members. 34\n\nPositive coaching your staff\n\nThere is not a best practice you can use to solve all\n\nof the problems in your gym, but there is a practice that comes closer than you might believe possible. It’s called positive coaching and it can seriously reduce the number of mistakes and miscommunications in your company, which in turn can improve profits. Positive coaching—which includes carefully describ- ing both the desired results and how to achieve them before the work begins—gives employees a great opportunity to move their performance from average to excellent. Unfortunately, because managers often mistakenly believe that employees already understand the process, they fail to coach before-hand. Here are some steps owners / managers can take to\n\nimprove their coaching skills:\n\nAllow\tplenty\tof\ttime\tfor\tquestions\tand\texplana- tions before the work begins. Recognize the truth in the old laugh line, “I know you think that you understand what I said but what you heard is not what I meant.” Say the same thing in several dif- ferent ways and ask questions to make sure to be sure you’re understood. Set\tclear\tperformance\texpectations\tthat\tfall\twithin\t your employees’ ability levels, and then challenge them to outperform themselves. Challenges show employees you have confidence in their abilities and can see their potential for excellence. Provide\tample\topportunities\tto\tpractice\tnew\tskills. Don’t expect anyone to perform a task well the first time. All learning is really re-cognition, or repeating an initial understanding. Help\teach\tindividual\tin\tyour\tgroup\tto\tdo\this\tor\ther\t best by monitoring progress and providing posi- tive feedback. Share knowledge, and assign tasks and responsibilities that encourage employees to stretch their abilities. Hold\temployees\taccountable\tfor\tthe\twork\tthey do. Praise employees whose performances meet and exceed expectations, and discuss improve- ment plans with poor performers. Be\ta\tcatalyst\tfor\tgroup\tsuccess\tby\thelping\tem- ployees to work well with each other. Organize work groups so that each person can perform at his or her optimum level. Partner employees with compatible personalities whenever possible. Remember\tthat\tthe\tgoal\tis\timproving\tthe\tem- ployee’s performance, not outperforming the\n\nBest Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nemployee. Managers don’t need to be better at doing employees’ jobs or superior to others in the group, and those who try to meet those standards usually fail to develop their managerial skills. Good coaches support their players; they do not compete with them. Use\tthe\tleadership\tstyle\tmost\tappropri- ate for the person or group you’re coaching. Avoid making a false distinction between man- agement and leadership. Management is what you do and leadership is how you do it. Many managers believe that dealing with employee issues is not part of their job and that they have other, more important work to do. Those people somehow segre- gate their human resources/per- sonnel duties from their gym duties and fail to realize that employee man- agement IS their job. 85% of your success is attributed to how you relate to other people, only 15% of your success is the result of technical skills. Another effective technique of positive coaching staff\n\nis turning employees into advocates for your business. This may depend on whether you use power or influ- ence to accomplish tasks. There’s nothing wrong with using power if the situation requires it. But, power is often used when it is not needed, and the unintended results can be costly, creating a silent adversary. By con- trast, influence recognizes and respects the individual, who can become a dedicated advocate. For example, let’s say your gym has just added a new tumbling class. You could accomplish the task by telling your coaches the day and time of the class, the fee you will be charging, how many students you need and what you want them taught. That’s a power approach."
    ],
    [
        "It will probably get the class, but it may not provide what you really want, which is a positive work environ- ment that helps employees perform their jobs in the most productive fashion. On the other hand, you could say to your teachers,\n\n“We want a new tumbling class, with lots of happy children learning power skills. Please tell me what you can provide that will help us create a session that our students and coaches will enjoy and which enhances productivity.” By asking for help, you have influenced\n\n35\n\nthe staff to collaborate with you to realize one of your company’s primary goals. Power that is exercised insensitively is received by many people as coercive orders that often instill fear. By contrast, influence speaks politely and asks ques- tions, which promotes understanding and creates collaboration between the two parties…\n\npositive coaching! Exercising influence works in all relationships and is as just effective at gaining the sup- port and help of employees as\n\nit is with customers. In today’s cross-functional\n\nworkplace, managers frequently find themselves working with peers from other departments. While it is important to understand what other departments do, it is even more important that departmental interactions\n\nare smooth and satisfactory to everyone concerned. If you want to influence your peers in a certain\n\nway, ask questions so you can under- stand their needs, and then formulate your action plan so that it is a win-win proposition for all involved. Try influencing your employees, you’ll see just how powerful influence can be. Finally, recognize that to coach someone effectively, you must genuinely care about the person as much as you do the outcome. Managing people today means finding effective ways to help them release their tal- ents and realize their potential for success—the exact same things that people who coach winning teams do. Mentorship in gymnastics organizations By definition, a Mentor is a close, trusted, and experienced counselor or guide. A mentor is further defined as a teacher, tutor, and coach. Mentorship is defined as the influence, guidance, or direction exerted by a mentor. Much like a coach guides and assists their gymnasts; mentors provide direction and assistance to others. Modern use of mentor refers to an experienced, senior leader or manager who develops younger, less experienced leaders and provides career counseling and sponsorship to these individuals. Mentorship contributes to the development of these\n\nfuture leaders. Mentorship is a two-way street. The mentor must be willing to share knowledge, training,\n\nBest Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nand experience in a trusted and respected atmosphere. In turn, the individual receiving the mentorship must trust and respect the mentor, while being open and receptive to the process. Caring is the core of mentor- ship. A mentor may care as a parent cares. We must remember that mentorship means taking some risks, to include allowing our mentee to make mistakes during their training. Mentors risk disappointment, failure, and rejection. We need to clarify their goals and help develop long- term career strategies toward advancement. We should also aid in developing their short-term career plans. We must share our knowledge and instruct them in techni- cal, leadership and management skills. Mentoring is a tool that organizations can use to nurture and grow their people. It can be an informal practice or a formal program. Mentors demonstrate, explain and model. Mentees observe, question, and explore. The following assumptions form the founda- tion for a solid mentoring program. Deliberate\tlearning\tis\tthe\tcornerstone. The\tmen- tor’s job is to promote intentional learning, which includes capacity building through methods such as instructing, coaching, providing experiences, modeling and advising. Both\tfailure\tand\tsuccess\tare\tpowerful\tteachers. Mentors, as leaders of a learning experience, certainly need to share their “how to do it so it comes out right” stories. They also need to share their experiences of failure, i.e., “how I did it wrong”. Both types of stories are powerful lessons that provide valuable opportunities for analyzing individual and organizational realities. Leaders\tneed\tto\ttell\ttheir\tstories. Personal\tscenar- ios, anecdotes and case examples, because they offer valuable, often unforgettable insight, must be shared. Mentors who can talk about them- selves and their experiences establish a rapport that makes them “learning leaders.”\n\nDevelopment\tmatures\tover\ttime. Mentoring\n\nwhen it works - taps into continuous learning that is not an event, or even a string of discrete events. Rather, it is the synthesis of ongoing event, experiences, observation, studies, and thoughtful analyses. Mentoring\tis\ta\tjoint\tventure. Successful\tmentoring\t means sharing responsibility for learning. Regard- less of the facilities, the subject matter, the timing, and all other variables. Successful mentoring begins with setting a contract for learning around which the mentor, the mentee, and their respec- tive line supervisors are aligned. 36\n\nThe Mentoring Relationship\n\nAn important element of the mentoring relation- ship is setting and facilitating clearly defined learning objectives. The process may begin with a first meeting where both parties can discuss their expectations."
    ],
    [
        "More detailed objectives can be defined and adopted as the relationship evolves. At the first meeting start-up issues, expectations, and initial goals should be addressed. On-Going Communication\n\nRegular communication is important in order to ef- fectively maintain the mentor-mentee relationship. The closer the communication, the more likely the program will be successful. Evolution of the Relationship\n\nAfter the first meeting between mentor and the mentee has occurred, the role of the mentor in regard to coaching, counseling, facilitating, and networking will begin to take shape. Both parties should come well prepared to all meetings so that the relationship can develop smoothly. Phases of a Mentoring Relationship\n\nThe mentoring relationship typically has four distinct\n\nphases:\n\nOrientation – building the base. During the early stages, both the mentor and mentee are getting to know each other, and building trust. At this time, both the mentee and the mentor are developing expectations of each other. The interaction, which occurs at this stage, will lay the foundation for a strong and beneficial relation- ship. The middle period. The middle phase is typically the most rewarding time for both mentor and mentee. The mutual trust, which has developed between the two, can give the mentee the confi- dence to challenge the ideas of the mentor, just as the mentor will challenge the mentee’s ideas. Dissolving the relationship. Typically, the relationship begins to draw apart after a year or two. It is important, at this stage that the mentor step back from the formal relationship to discuss together with the mentee how they wish to con- tinue their relationship. Redefining the relationship. The mentor- mentee relationship enters a new phase, where both parties can regard one another as equals. They continue to have some form of interaction, although it is now on a more casual basis. Best Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nMentoring – Potential Pitfalls\n\nMentoring relationships do not always succeed. Some of the most frequent problems with mentoring relationships include:\n\n‘Mismatch’ between mentor and mentee. A mismatch between the mentor and the mentee can be a cause of failure in the relationship. One or both members of the relationship may feel uneasy with the other, or they may not be able to achieve the level of friendship necessary for rich communication. Under such circumstances it may be necessary to assign the young mentee to a dif- ferent mentor. If the problem is identified during the first six months of the relationship the change can usually be made in an amicable way with no hard feelings on either side. Unrealistic expectations. Problems in the relationship can also occur if the mentee expects or demands too much from the mentor. It is important, therefore, that expectations are clearly defined from the beginning. The mentee should not expect the relationship to meet every need, nor for it to continue indefinitely. Breaches of confidentiality. In order to develop the type of relationship in which the mentor can be effective, he or she must first be perceived as trustworthy and able to keep confidences. Since both parties in a mentoring relationship typi-\n\ncally realize and accept the fact that a high level of trust is essential in order for an effective relationship to develop, there is little evidence of breaches of confi- dentiality. However, codes of conduct regarding the confidential nature of the relationship should be clearly defined and understood by both parties at the begin- ning of every mentoring relationship.

Whether or not an individual is suited to the role of mentor may depend on his or her own stage of development and experience. For example, a fairly successful individual may have had a specific, or limited, background and may not have enough general experience to offer. Prior to entering into a mentoring relationship, the men- tee should assume the responsibility of assessing the mentor’s potential effectiveness. The qualities, which are essential in an effective men-\n\ntor, include:\n\nA desire to help. Individuals who are interested in and willing to help others."

EMPLOYEE MANUALS\n\nHaving a policies and procedures manual in place may\n\nmake the difference between smooth transitions and troubled times. Organizations find that a policies and procedures\tmanual\t(aka\tOperations\tManual)\tis\ta\tuseful\t training tool for new employees and a reference tool for efficiently dealing with customers. Well thought out policies and procedures can head off potential trouble during the course of regular business. Any employer that decides to implement personnel policies and proce- dures and/or prepare and distribute an employee hand- book must first evaluate its own culture and its desire to communicate to employees in a more formal and struc- tured manner. If an employer decides to issue an employee handbook or policy manual, the following materials pro- vide an overview of some of the issues an employer must address when preparing a handbook or policy manual. All policies should be tailored to reflect the employer’s own business and unique needs. The materials contained herein are not intended to constitute or provide legal advice. Employers drafting or revising an employee handbook or employment policy manual should have that handbook or manual first reviewed by legal counsel before implementing and distributing to employees. Here are some of the policies and procedures your\n\nmanual should include, how your agency can prepare one, and how to avoid common mistakes. Policy: A policy is a statement of operating intent that explains a particular action or function and why it is necessary. Written in terms that allow for some flexibility\tin\tinterpretation. (i.e. “We\toffer\ta\tmoney\t back\tguarantee\tif\tnot\tcompletely\tsatisfied.”)\tPolicies\t help dictate employees’ general behavior and are intended to serve as guidelines for implementing plans and solving frequently occurring problems. Policies will not be effective if your employees do not understand your organization’s overall objectives and goals. Procedure: A procedure is a prescribed method for implementing a policy. Procedures are the estab- lished protocol for the implementation of a policy. It is usually an extensively detailed statement and specifically limits or directs the actions of those in- volved."

        "(i.e. “To\tprocess\ta\tcustomer\trefund\trequest:\t Fill\tout\tthe\ttop\tsection\tof\tthe\tblue\tform\ttitled…”)\n\nBest Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nHow to Get Started\n\nCreate a master file for all documents you’ll need in preparing your manual. Start a three-ring binder or use computer technology to maintain and manage all pertinent documents. A three-ring binder may be the best format for maintaining employee handbooks. Revisions can be made without reprinting the entire document. Each page in the manual should be dated to reflect its timeliness. There are a variety of policies and procedures which reflect the business policies, practices and opera- tions of a particular employer. Divide the manual into sections for each major area. Collect existing policies and procedures related to each section. Manuals or documents that indicate or describe the organization’s policies on various issues will be helpful. For sections where your agency has not adopted written policies and procedures, insert blank sheets of paper. Use them to draft outlines of what you think your organization’s poli- cies and procedures should be for these areas. To ensure consistency, objectivity and uniformity in the interpreta- tion and application of such policies and procedures, and to give employees the opportunity to understand the rules and regulations which govern their working environ- ment, employers may want to consider including in a handbook some of the following sections and/or policies and procedures:\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn this section the employer should welcome employ-\n\nees to the company. The history of the organization and vision / mission statement should be included at the beginning of the policy manual. Employment Issues\n\nThere\tare\tmany\tpersonnel\t(human\tresources)\tissues\t that arise in the operation of any business. Employers may want to consider writing guidelines and rules relat- ing to any of the following:\n\nemployment\tof\trelatives •\t employee\tmedical\texams •\t immigration\tlaw\tcompliance •\t conflict\tof\tinterest\tissues •\t outside\temployment •\t non-compete\tstatement •\t non-disclosure\tstatement •\t access\tto\tpersonnel\tfiles •\t drug\ttesting\tpolicy •\t blood\tborne\tpathogen\t(including\tAIDS)\tpolicy •\t background\tcheck •\t USA\tGymnastics\tmembership •\t personnel\t(personal\tstatus\tchanges)\tdata\tchanges •\t introductory\t/\tprobationary\t/\ttraining\tperiod •\t work\tschedules •\t rest\tand/or\tmeal\tperiods\n\n39\n\nA handbook or policy manual should always be reviewed to make sure that the written language actually means what it says and does not say or imply something about the employment relationship that the company does not intend. Every word of an employee handbook should be read carefully to see if it can be interpreted to mean something different than what the company intended it to mean. Any promises or guarantees in a handbook or policy manual should be eliminated unless the employer is prepared to be bound by its promises and guarantees. Avoid the use of “will,” “shall” or “must” when discussing employer’s obliga- tions toward employees. These words tend to connote a contractual guarantee. Eliminate any promises or repre- sentation made of “job security” or promotional opportu- nities. The employer may have a legal obligation to fulfill these perceived promises if found in the handbook. Operational Issues\n\nThere are also many issues that arise in the day-to- day running of any business. Employers may also want to consider writing guidelines and rules relating to any of the following:\n\nsafety •\t business\texpenses •\t use\tof\tphone\tand\tmail\tsystems •\t emergency\taction\tplans •\t program\tinformation •\t use\tof\tcompany\tequipment\tand\tvehicles •\t tobacco\tuse •\t uniforms •\t finance\tand\taccounting •\t facility\toperations •\t use\tof\tfacility\tguidelines •\t customer\tservice •\t registrations •\t refunds •\t transfers •\t orientations •\t FAQ’s •\t forms,\tetc. Add other sections that your agency considers vital to its success. It is a good idea to annually review your employee handbook to see whether any revisions are required. Although the cost of regularly updating the handbook is a consideration, the ramifications of not doing so could be much more substantial. Failing to maintain your handbook increases the likelihood of legal action by a disgruntled employee or a serious. After deciding to write or update your policies and procedures manual, put it on the agenda for the next staff meeting or meeting of the board of directors. This is so management can prioritize the project and allocate resources to complete it. Best Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nManual Dos and Don’ts\n\nDeveloping an effective manual will take time, and you may be hesitant to start. Keep in mind the benefit of pro- ducing your own manual—and learn from other peoples mistakes. Here are some dos and don’ts to help you avoid common mistakes that can lower employee moral, waste staff time, drain income, and risk costly lawsuits and legal actions. Write\tpolicies\tbefore\tyou\tneed\tthem. Some\tagen- cies don’t see the need—or don’t want to take the time—to decide on their policies and procedures comprehensively in advance and put them in writ- ing. Instead, they wait until a problem has arisen and its handling has been botched. Learning the hard way is not recommended, especially when you consider that every organization has sets of issues that can lead to big problems. Do\twrite\tthe\tpolicies\tand\tprocedures\tmanual\tearly\t in your operation’s life. Review it periodically for needed changes or improvements. Accounting and computer policies and procedures, in particu- lar, require more frequent updating as you change accounting software programs, outsource opera- tions or return them in-house and adapt to techno- logical advances. Manuals updated to reflect these types of changes are more useful for employees. Don’t\tcopy\tanother\tagency’s\tmanual. Copying someone else’s manual is common. Although it may be quicker and cheaper in the short run, it could cost more in the long run. And you may implement poli- cies and procedures you do not understand or that do not apply to your organization. It is acceptable to use another operation’s policies as a template but take the time to create your own set of procedures. Don’t\twrite\tyour\tmanual\tas\tthough\tyou\tdistrust\tyour\t employees or customers. Writing your manual as though you are expecting trouble and don’t trust or respect your customers and employees is bound to create resentment and resistance. Employees will perceive the manual as something negative that is being imposed on them. Customers will soon recognize restrictive policies and archaic procedures and take their business elsewhere. Do\tensure\tyour\tmanual\tconveys\tto\tcustomers\tand\t employees that you are committed to providing a quality business environment. This means a manual that enables every employee to reach his or her highest possible level of professional fulfill- ment. In return, you hope that your employees will expend maximum effort toward performing their jobs and achieving your organization’s goals. 40\n\nDon’t\tdiscount\tthe\tvalue\tof\tdocumented\tpolicies\tand\t procedures. Many organizations take the initial step of writing down their policies and procedures, and then fail to take final steps that give them the pro- tection they need. They neglect to have employees “sign off” on the policies, and they fail to document problems when employees violate the policies or fail to perform their jobs’ essential functions. Do\tthoroughly\tdocument\temployees’\tperformance\t problems and policy violations in writing. If em- ployees violate your policies or fail to perform jobs adequately, you will ultimately be forced to take cor- rective action. You may have to discharge employ- ees, after which they’ll immediately seek unemploy- ment compensation. Fortunately, you may not be liable for the claim if you can show the discharge was for a valid, business-related cause. Documenta- tion can help protect your rights and control possible litigation costs. A Good Start\n\nOnce a rough draft of your organization’s policies and procedures has been made, you may need to present it for review both at this stage and after you have reviewed it in detail and begun customizing it to fit your special goals and needs. In either case, your policies and proce- dures manual will likely undergo many management and commission revisions – it should be considered a “working document” that may never be a final edition. When\tdistributing\thandbooks\t(whether\tnew\tor\trevised)\t to employees, it is highly recommended that the em- ployer include a separate acknowledgement form to be signed by the employee and returned for retention in the employee’s personnel file. The form should acknowledge receipt of the hand- book, indicate that the employee has agreed to read and become familiar with the provisions contained in the hand- book and acknowledge the at-will relationship. A form which contains this above information and is signed by the employee will provide the employer with a better defense against breach of contract claims:\n\nEmployers may want to add a statement to the em- ployee acknowledgement form or in the introduction section recommending that employees consult their supervisor or human resources manager if they do not understand any statements or policies or procedures in the handbook. Continue to update and improve them and your organization will benefit from policies and procedures that WORK. In the Appendix is a sample code of conduct for employees that summarize expectations and respon- sibilities. Also in the Appendix are sample forms for\n\nBest Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nemployees to sign acknowledging receipt of your policy manual and guidebook. STAFF TRAINING\n\nIt is imperative to provide your employees with\n\nall the direction, training, and the tools necessary for them to fulfill their obligations. Depending upon their experience and work history, a new teacher could begin as an aide for a Senior Instructor for three months up to a year or they may be allowed to instruct their own class after a short orientation of work- ing with another instructor for as little as a day or two. Regularly scheduled staff meetings and in-service train- ing should be conducted to help ensure that all staff uses proper technique and follows sound child development practices. In addition, con- duct a number a various certification courses (usually\tduring\tthe\tbreak\tbetween\tChristmas\tand\tNew\t Year\tholidays\tis\ta\tgood\ttime\tfor\tthis):\n\n1. Red Cross CPR and First Aid. All course fees could be paid for by the employer and staff could be paid for their time in class. It is recommended that this certification be a mandatory course for all full-time staff. CPR certification is valid for one year and must be renewed annually; First Aid is a three-year certification. 2."

    [
        "A number of other professional certifications are available and should be offered – accreditations, early childhood education courses, etc. Staff should also be offered the opportunity to attend Confer- ences and Workshops as they are announced. It is recommended to encourage all staff to continue their professional education, upgrade their skills, and constantly improve! Visit www.usa-gymnastics.com for courses in education. Schedule\n\nConsistency is of utmost importance in developing a strong trusting relationship in the teacher. Students, particularly preschoolers, come to rely on the routine and comfort that a regular instructor provides. Al- though absences and substitutes are bound to occur and should be accepted, having a plan to deal with the change will help ease the transitions. 41\n\nIf staff needs to miss a class, proper notification of the change should be posted for the parents and class participants. A sample Time Off Policy and Time Off Request form is included in the Appendix. Parking\n\nEmployees should park in areas that leave the prime parking spaces available for the customers."
    ],
    [
        "While staff often\n\nfeels entitled to the privilege of\n\nparking close to the front door, that benefit belongs to the\n\ncustomer. Telephone\n\nManagement and supervi- sory personnel should main- tain the ability to monitor the telephone and voice mail systems to ensure compli- ance with the privacy in the workplace policy as well as for other legitimate business reasons, including the desire to ensure that calls\n\nare handled in a professional manner and\n\nto promote efficiency in the manner in which callers are treated. No personal phone calls should be allowed while on duty and any violation of this policy could result in progressive discipline and possible termination of employment. The use of cell phones while on duty must be limited to emergency use ONLY. Cell phones should be turned off while on duty. Personal calls must be limited to during off-duty time. Lockers\n\nIf the organization provides lockers for personnel to\n\nkeep personal belongings, all personal property may be locked but the organization should reserve the right to inspect and/or examine the contents at any time. In compliance with privacy in the workplace policy, en- courage staff to leave valuables at home as the organi- zation should not be responsible for lost or stolen items. Staff responsibilities\n\nThe primary goal of any program should be to pro- vide a safe, secure and enjoyable environment for the children enrolled in it. All staff must be responsible for understanding and following the mission, the policies and procedures."
    ],
    [
        "Failure to follow any of these policies may result in disciplinary action or the termination of employment. The most difficult complaint that most gym owners /\n\ndirectors receive is “lack of enthusiasm by the teach-\n\nBest Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\ners.” A smile goes a long way toward keeping students and parents satisfied. All teachers are required to assist in every class."

    [
        "There can be ABSOLUTELY NO SITTING AROUND and visiting during class times. Staff needs to set a positive “work ethic” example. Keep busy with controlled high energy! It is essential that staff follows the rotation sched- ules as closely as possible. Following rotations sets an example of discipline and structure and allows teachers to plan class activities accordingly. All equipment that is used during a rotation must be cleaned up before that class moves. Do not leave stations out for the next group to clean up. This is also a good time to ask that everyone pitch in to keep the entire area clean and organized; if you see paper on the floor, grips lying about, etc. please clean it up. Staff is always responsible for their class. If staff has any\tproblem\t(with\ta\tstudent,\ta\tparent,\twith\tequipment,\t or\twith\ta\tco-worker,\tetc.),\tLET\tTHE\tCOORDINATOR\t KNOW IMMEDIATELY! Staff must all work together to ensure an enjoyable experience for everyone — stu- dents, parents, and staff. Staff is to report at the assigned time to work. The time that staff is on duty is to be used for work related responsibilities – no personal business should be con- ducted during work time. If staff is not assigned a duty and has time on their hands they are to report to the Coordinator for further instructions and assignments. If for any reason a staff member will be arriving late, they are to call as soon as possible. Excessive tardiness may result in termination. If a staff member is ill, they are also to call as soon as possible. Abuse of the sick leave policy may result in termination. It is essential that the program have all staff members on duty to avoid conflict amongst co-workers. Time off must be requested in writing, one week before and will only be granted if a substitute can be found. All mobile program drivers are to fill out a driver’s daily report and return it to the Coordinator. If fuel indi- cator is at half, drivers are to fill the van, either at the beginning of their schedule or after. All garbage or be- longings of the children is to be cleared from the vans at the end of each activity. If vans are found littered with garbage at the beginning of your runs, it should be reported to the Coordinator. All van windows must be closed, the doors locked and the van parked in the designated spot after the last activity. If there is a main- tenance problem with any of the vans, a report should be filled out and the Coordinator should be notified as soon as possible. Staff shall not encourage or engage in play fighting,\n\nkicking,\twrestling\t(horseplay)\twith\tchildren\tor\tother\t staff or allow children to do this with each other. It is part of staff’s job to interact and nurture the\n\n42\n\nchildren. It is expected of each teacher to be up and in- teracting with the children. Sitting down, falling asleep, talking on the telephone or reading while in the class is unacceptable. Clumping together with other teachers to talk is not what is expected of staff, and may result in progressive discipline or termination. Never yell or shout at a child, especially in anger. Staff may raise their voice to be heard, if there is a lot of confusion going on, but not in anger or to discipline a child. If a teacher begins getting upset, ask another teacher to take over the discipline problem or bring the child to the office. Never tell a child or a group to shut up! Never tease them, call them names or make fun of them. Make contact with the parents in the group, know their names, introduce yourself or just say hello or good night. Not all parents will stop and chat and are often in hurry, but it is important that staff acknowledges them\tand\tinitiates\tsome\tkind\tof\tcontact\twith\tthem\t(a\t simple nod with direct eye contact and a simple wave works). Staff enthusiasm is essential to the success of any program. Staff shall not sit while supervising the chil- dren except while helping with a direct skill, as a part of teaching the children, etc. Staff may lean but may not sit while on duty. There may be times when staff has low energy levels, but it is important to overcome this. Staff is there for the children and with anything less; staff will not be doing their job. Engage with the children and attentively supervise them. Be a part of their Gymnastics experience! It is unprofessional to eat in front of the children. Leaving the work site to get food or drink is not per- mitted. Children are not permitted to use the vending machine except after class. Staff is expected to follow any directions given by a supervisor at the time the directions are given. If there are questions or concerns about these directions, they should be discussed with the supervisor at a later time – away from the children and parents. Never threaten a child or use positive behavior as a\n\ndiscipline\ttool\t(i.e. picking\tup\ttrash\tis\ta\tpositive\tbe- havior we like to encourage people to do, exercise is a\tpositive\tbehavior\twe\trecommend\tchildren\tdo,\tetc.). Natural consequences for negative behavior are the only accepted practice – exclusion from participating in\tan\tenjoyable\tactivity\t(a\ttime\tout),\texclusion\tfrom\t participating\tin\tan\tenjoyable\tactivity\t(a\ttime\tout),\tbe- ing sent to the Coordinator, being sent home, etc. are some examples of the kinds of disciplinary acts that should be practiced. Teachers will be assigned specific job responsibilities and will be held accountable if they are not completed. Best Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nAppearance\n\nBeauty is only skin deep and it is true that you can’t judge a book by its cover, but appearance and first im- pressions mean a lot. Therefore, uniforms are required to be worn by every employee!!! Staff will not be paid if they are not in proper uniform. We recommend black shorts\tor\tblack\tpants\tbut\tthe\tblack\t(with\twhite\tstripes)\t uniform shirts are a must. Open toed shoes or sandals are not recommended."

        "You will be treated as a professional if you look like a professional. Cleanliness is next to godliness but neatness counts – clean clothes, well manicured, and showered. Professionalism is the key\n\nYou will play a very important part in the lives of the children who take part in your groups. In order for our program to be a success, YOU must present a positive role for your students to emulate. We must help in the development of better “junior citizens” and offer them an enjoyable experience in which to grow. It is your job to make them want to take part and to find value in their participation. We are all to work toward maximizing the potential\n\neach child has in our care. Our goal is to meet the individual needs of each student and understand that everyone progresses at a different pace mentally and physically. We must spend equal amounts of time with each child making certain that his/her individual needs are being met. We want every student to feel special. We will listen to them and communicate with them in a positive manner. We will promote overall physi- cal fitness and the importance of having a strong and healthy body. We will teach discipline and the impor- tance of following directions. The children should learn respect for each other and their teachers. Above all we will develop courage and self-esteem and help the children learn that social involvement is a great and enjoyable stepping stone to the rest of their life. Remember that motivation is almost impossible to pass on to someone else, the best we can do is inspire. Motivation is internal and may or may not develop as a child grows. Inspiration is an ex- ternal force that we can use if we are positive, excited, and enthusiastic about learning. Praise goes a long way toward inspiring a young child. You can’t overdo it. Make a big deal when a child learns a new skill, make a big deal when a student performs well, make a big deal when a child behaves with courtesy, and make a big deal when a child tries hard. Always continue to praise and speak positively to the rest of the class while your star student is receiving his/her “reward” so that the other students don’t resent you or their classmate. 43\n\nEasy ways to reward your staff\n\nOne of the bigger challenges of being a manager\n\nor business owner is figuring out how to motivate and reward your employees. One of the key points in effectively managing human resources is to catch people doing something right and tell them about it immediately. It takes some work to recognize and prop- erly reward your staff. The payoff can be huge – in a highly motivated and loyal crew that enjoys their work enough to become long-term employees that represent you and your business well. You may also find that you have created a culture where people are eager to apply to work for you because of your reputation of treating employees well. I have a few suggestions on ways you can reward your staff – without breaking the bank. On a daily basis you can try to greet every person by name and with a genuine smile. I want my employees to know that I value their place in our organization. Getting personally involved has limits but a simple; “I hope your dog is doing better after his surgery” or “I’m sorry your son was sick and missed school yesterday” shows compassion and interest and means a lot to a person. Take every opportunity to praise them in public."

        "A little goes a long way. It takes a little planning and preparation but rewarding your employees does not have to be expensive. Being effective may require a concerted effort and a time commitment but the effort does pay off. At a recent Gymnastics conference, Steve Greeley from Imagymnation in Simi Valley, CA shared with the attendees of a business round table his experience in hosting an extremely successful Christmas party for his employees. He presented gifts and presents for his staff and the event has turned into an annual event that his workers look forward to all year. A great reward for your staff is when you help make work fun. Just like we want our kids to enjoy Gymnas- tics, we want our teachers to enjoy their jobs. Have little birthday celebrations – complete with a goofy hat and a cupcake with a candle. Give them a hand-written thank you card. Let them choose the music at the gym. Ring a bell and make public announcements lauding their accomplishments. Every employee is unique and different things work for different people. You will have to decide what motivates your staff. The key is to be sincere, do the best you can without worrying about not doing it well enough. One thing to remember is to avoid the word “but” when rewarding a job well done. It takes away every- thing you may be trying to accomplish by saying, “You did a great job on that project, but I would have…” or “Nice work, but did you ever try…”\n\nThere are also a number of great business manage- ment books available, from The One Minute Manager\n\nBest Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nby Ken Blanchard and Spencer Johnson to Bob Nel- son’s 1001 Ways to Reward Employees just to name a couple.

When they came across a very large tree branch the boy asked, “Do you think I could move that branch?” His father answered, “If you use all your strength, I’m sure you can.” So the boy tried mightily to lift, pull and push the branch but he couldn’t move it."

        "Discouraged he said, “Dad, you were wrong. I can’t do it.” His dad said, “Try again.” This time, as the boy struggled with the branch his father joined him and to-\n\n44\n\ngether they pushed the branch aside. “Son,” the father said, “the first time you didn’t use all your strength. You didn’t ask me to help.”\n\nLike any other group of professionals, we’re always looking to build our professional networks, find career advice and uncover new industry resources. One way to further these goals is through becoming a member of a professional organization. The affiliation must not only provide a value to the individual, but should enhance or maximize the performance of the person to ultimately benefit the organization. Some associations have membership counts in the thousands, and it can be difficult to navigate such a vast crowd. The size of the group also affects how suc- cessful you can be in making meaningful contact at an event such as an industry Congress. Getting the most out of any professional association membership is like anything else in life—you’re going to get out of it as much as you put into it. Fortunately, there are some easy steps that you can follow to ensure that each of your association memberships is a success. Really think about what you’re trying to get out of this membership. Why are you thinking about joining an association? The following are a few questions to consider:\n\nWhat\tare\tyou\thoping\tto\taccomplish?"

Establishing clear objectives by answering these ques- tions before you start assessing potential organizations will greatly benefit you in the long run. Ask yourself specific questions about why you are spending the time and identify objectives for your participation. These two women will probably achieve what they’re seeking because they each defined what they are looking for. Each time they attend a program meeting, they have their objectives in the back of their minds—and are looking for ways to meet them. You won’t meet people by walking into a room of 500 to 1,000 association members and handing out business cards. You’re not going to get specific career advice or develop potential business leads that way. Even though you might exchange business cards in that venue, it will be months before any kind of meaning- ful relationship is developed. The smaller committees and task forces that you will work on, the events you will help plan, the programs you will help coordinate by volunteering your time—that’s where you’re really going to develop working relationships with other members.

Professional membership confers a special status on\n\nthose who hold it. Memberships open a pathway to join the rapidly expanding world of the professional; members who are found around the country, as well as those in the international community of like-minded individuals and organizations. Membership presents opportunities for competition, professional recognition and access to educational forums. The number of gymnastics business operations has more than tripled since 1972, and the industry continues to grow and change rapidly. Growth in our industry has thrust a major impact on our profession; an impact we will continue to feel. The number and variety of gymnastics related operations also continues to change. New jobs are appearing as the industry grows more complex. Coaches are more sophisticated in their thinking and even more specialized in their presentation. More is the operative word no matter where you look throughout the industry: more large organizations, more chains, more managerial positions and titles, more variety, more development of new op- portunities, more women and minorities. Being a part of a professional membership organization adds up to more opportunity for you and your career development or advancement.

        "If you are afraid that confidential information will be leaked inappropriately, you will hold back your opin- ions and guard your words. A management team must trust each other to keep confidences, or it will never be able to create a comfortable climate to have a candid discussion. If someone leaves a meeting and says to an outsider, “Charlie didn’t want to support this new policy and he really got angry with Janet when she said...” he or she has broken the seal of trust. Com- ments like this can undermine decisions and create a paranoid and negative political climate."

        "2. Disagree in private; be united in public. A management team that is unwilling or unable to de- bate and disagree is doomed to be fundamentally weak and ineffective. Lively debates usually produce the best, workable solutions to complex problems but once that solution is reached, a united front is required to sustain it and enforce it. We know what happens when children try to get their way by working on the lenient parent. The same thing often happens when employees know someone who doesn’t support a policy or decision. Just as parents need to be united on decisions at home, managers need to show united support to one another. If a man- ager walks out of a meeting and says to an employee, “Well, I certainly don’t support that decision...” or “Only half of the management team supported that decision because it favors their departments,” the en- tire management team’s credibility is weakened. 3. Silence is agreement. We all know about the ‘meetings after the meeting’ — the closed-door conversations where everyone shares their true feelings. Healthy decision-making requires that all opinions be put on the table. If someone silently disagrees, it isn’t fair to the rest of the team. Then, if the person walks out the door and badmouths the decision, the person undermines the integrity of the process. 4."

        "Attack problems, not people. This is an old ground rule but it’s still a good ground rule. People need to feel safe enough to voice their honest opinions. If someone in the group jumps down your throat or attacks with a sarcastic remark, you are likely to either retaliate or shut down completely. In either case, open dialogue is dead. 5."

        "Listen without interrupting. This may sound simple, but in the heat of a discussion people tend to spend their energy defending their own\n\nBest Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nposition instead of listening to the thoughts of oth- ers. During meetings, soft-spoken members’ ideas are sometimes ignored, aggressive members tromp over the words of others and eager participants are so busy generating ideas, their enthusiasm causes them to jump in before others are finished speaking. A leader’s job is to keep the participation balanced and safe for all. 6. Proactively manage the agenda. Meetings without a clear agenda are destined to spin wheels and frustrate the participants. Wise leaders know that a well-managed process is as important as the group dynamics. A short time frame should cause the agenda to be shortened to the vital few topics. A controversial topic may be the only item on the agenda. A topic requiring a decision should require the attendance of all stakeholders. For a meeting to be suc- cessful, the process must be designed to fit the results you want to achieve. Employee performance As a business owner, you need to enlighten, motivate, and ultimately inspire your employees. There are many models and systems available to help you accom- plish that goal. Inspired leadership focuses on results; establishing clear goals and expectations for what you are trying to accomplish and requires involving your employees at all levels. It all begins with a few best practices\tfor\tresults-based\t(also\tknown\tas\tperformance- based)\tmanagement:\n\nShare your vision with your employees. You must run a completely transparent operation. With results-based management, employees need to have a sense of ownership. They know beyond the shadow of a doubt what your company stands for and where it’s going. If they don’t know the big picture, how can they make it their own? Besides, when employees have a clear picture of your mission and vision, the expectations you help them set will make sense to them. They’ll be more likely to buy into and achieve the intended outcomes. Work with your staff to set challenging, yet attainable goals. Just like you work with your gymnasts to help them develop their goals so you can create a plan to help them achieve those goals, work with your staff on their performance goals. That’s right, work with them. Don’t impose expectations on your employees. In order to get buy-in, you need to make certain that the work- ers have helped create their objectives. Sit down with employees and hammer out goals together. 47\n\nMake it a priority. Never assume that your staff automatically knows what they’re supposed to be doing. Clear and concise objectives are as vital to your employees’ performance as equipment is to your gymnasts. Give them a real voice in the company’s future."
    ],
    [
        "Don’t just let employees set their own expectations. Let them have real input into the company’s future. No matter how often you tell your employees “this is your company, too,” if they have no real say-so, it’s just lip service. Col- laborate with them."
    ],
    [
        "Solicit their ideas and contri- butions. More precisely, actually take their advice and run with it. If you don’t trust your employees enough to help shape your company’s future, why did you hire them in the first place? Make sure their work is meaningful. Take ad- vantage of the talent in your organization. No one likes busywork or routine, mind-numbing tasks. Give your employees challenging assignments and expectations that stimulate their minds and that have a real impact on your organization. If you sense that an employee is just going through the motions, take him to lunch and ask, “What would challenge you?” Ask him to come up with a new product or service or process for your company and then let him be in charge of the project. It’s amazing how few leaders really do this—but it’s a tremendously empowering and inspiring gesture. Tell your employees it’s okay to take risks—in fact, it’s expected. A big part of being successful involves Risk; without it there can be no signifi- cant gain. Just like innovation in gymnastics takes place by those athletes willing to take the risk to try new skills, you need to make the possibility of failure OK. This is the real reason you need to keep the “big picture” in front of employees at all times—it helps them take calculated risks aimed at advancing not only their own expectations but also your corporate vision. When people are free to take risks, they are likely to explore multiple possibilities and find unexpected solutions. They will own these solutions and hold themselves accountable. To inspire risk-taking in your employ- ees, take risks yourself. In this way you model the creative spirit you want them to embrace. Put systems in place for measuring productiv- ity. The whole point of a results-oriented culture is to help employees become more productive. That’s why you must be sure not to confuse activity with progress. There is a big difference between being busy and being productive. Put\n\nBest Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nsystems in place for measuring productivity and live by them. What gets measured gets done. Do everything you can to eliminate redundancies and make sure your people understand that being busy is not the same as being productive. Your gymnasts can spend a lot of time in the gym; their success depends on how productive that time is. The same rule applies for your staff. Give both formal and “real time” feedback often. Establish\tongoing\t(recommended\tquar- terly)\tevaluation\tprocesses\tso\tpeople\tcan\tget\t feedback on how well they’re meeting their expectations. But don’t limit feedback to formal assessments. You should tell people in “real time” what they’re doing wrong so they can correct it, but it’s even more important to tell them what they’re doing right. Spontaneous coaching is one of the most critical elements of a positive-value culture. It is the pathway to productivity."

Covey wrote a best-selling book entitled The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. In it, Covey explained habits that assist people in becom- ing more effective and successful in their professional and personal lives. This book continues to be one of the most widely read books on the market. Although the book is targeted to the successful business executive, the strategies presented by Covey are entirely relevant and applicable to the Gymnastics Professional. The seven habits apply not only to working with students in classes; they are relevant in many aspects of one’s career. Covey\t(1989)\tdefined\ta\thabit\t“as\tthe\tintersection\tof\t knowledge,\tskill,\tand\tdesire”\t(p. 47). This\tmeans\tthat\t habits are a matter of knowing what needs to be done, knowing how to do it, and wanting to get it done. Habits are important because they determine one’s behaviors and shape one’s character. Like physical skills, habits are developed and learned. Thus, to create a good habit, one must address all three dimensions: the knowledge, the skill, and the desire. The seven habits that Covey identified are based on effectiveness. Taking those habits and translating them to the Gymnastics workplace, more specifically to teaching the sport, is not a stretch. In fact, it makes a lot of sense. The habits can be applied to working with students or colleagues. Adapted from a similar article by LeeAnn Martin, this piece will focus on how the seven habits can help Gymnastics Professionals work more successfully with administrators and other teachers. 1."

        "BE PROACTIvE. Being proactive is considered the most basic habit\n\nof the effective person. This goes beyond just tak- ing initiative; it requires taking responsibility for behaviors. Highly effective people do not blame their behaviors on their circum stances or situation. They understand that their behaviors are products of their own choices. Reactive people, on the other hand, are affected by their physical, social, and psychological\n\nBest Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nenvironments or stimuli. They react to and blame their behaviors on their surroundings, the people with whom they work, and how they are treated. For example, a reactive coach will blame his or her inadequate teach- ing on the lack of equipment or something unexpected (such\tas\tthe\tsudden\tloss\tof\ta\tfacility). The\treactive\t teacher will blame ineffective teaching on how he or she was treated by a coworker. A reactive response al- lows the person to avoid responsibility. Proactive coaches not only take responsibility for their\n\nteaching regardless of their physical, social or psycho- logical environment; they are “value driven.” Their behaviors are determined by what they hold important. Highly effective Gymnastics Instructors teach well, regardless of their environment, because they are com- mitted to their values and principles. Proactive people do not allow others’ behaviors or situations to influ- ence them, because they are able to focus on what is best for their students. Suppose there is a gym owner who does not ap- preciate PreSchool or Recreation classes, and his or her behaviors indicate little support for the program. As\ta\tresult,\tthe\tinstructor\tlearns\tthat\the\t(each\texample\t throughout\twill\talternate\t“he”\tand\t“she”)\twill\tlose\t his event rotation multiple times because there are other, “more important” uses for the equipment. In situations like these, the PreSchool teacher can choose one of several responses. He can accept it, buy into it, and behave as though he believes that it is accept- able to diminish the importance of his classes. Sec- ondly, he can use it as an excuse to teach poorly and put minimal effort into teaching and planning because “it won’t do any good.” As a third response, he could become argu mentative and demanding, probably trig- gering deteriora tion in the relationship he has with his boss. Or the teacher can choose a fourth re- sponse. He could see it as an opportunity to educate his owner, the parents of his students, and the other teachers about the importance and uniqueness of PreSchool classes. The pro active person chooses the last response, a response that does not empower someone else’s weakness to control them. Proactive coaches are driven by the values and principles that, hopefully, caused them to become teachers in the first place. Another aspect of being proactive is to make the choice to spend energy in productive ways. Covey suggested that all those things that concern an individual fall within a “circle of concern.” However, not everything that concerns teachers is within their control to change. Those things that teachers can indeed alter fall within the “circle of influence.” Why should teachers waste time and energy on things over which they have no control? Reactive people spend a significant amount of energy within the circle of con-\n\n49\n\ncern: they complain and blame their situations on the environment or on the behaviors of others. Proactive people spend their energies on things they actually can change or influence. Does the circle of influence increase in size? Of course! In teaching, there are always things the teacher cannot con trol, such as the students who are absent from class (which\tcan\twreak\thavoc\ton\tsched\tuled\twork\touts),\tor\t other\tteachers\tnot\tshowing\tup\tas\tscheduled\t(forcing\t other\tcoaches\tto\tadjust\ttheir\tplans). No\tamount\tof\t com plaining or concern can change such things, and these attitudes give opportunities for others to view the coach as a negative, worrisome person. Why not spend energy focusing on alternative activities for a make-up day, a different day for combined age-group activities, or an abbreviated lesson for the shortened class time? These ideas would be far more productive and effective for the students, and others will view the teacher as more up -beat and positive."
    ],
    [
        "The coach has not changed the students or other staff, but she has controlled the situation in a more effective way. When the owner or co-workers are unedu cated about PreSchool classes and fail to support it, reac tive people complain about co-workers and blame their own ineffective teaching on lack of support. Proactive people look for ways to educate colleagues, creat- ing\tavenues\tof\tcommunication\t(memos,\tnewsletters,\t invitations\tto\tattend\t/\tobserve\tclasses,\tetc.). As\ta\tresult,\t colleagues better understand what is happening in the gym. Colleagues may even begin to educate the par- ents, other teachers, and the Booster Club about what PreSchool gymnastics encompasses and needs. Being proactive depends largely on how much\n\nindividu als are willing to work on themselves and their responses. In other words, they take responsibility for their actions."

        "BEGIN WITH THE END IN MIND. To begin with the end in mind, one must visualize the end of one’s life as a frame of reference. Individu- als should ask, “What kind of person, or teacher, or friend, or partner do I want to be remembered as?” This becomes the criterion by which effective people govern their behaviors on a daily basis. “Does the behavior I ex- hibited today contribute to the image of how I want to be remembered?” By identifying what is important, one has a map or a compass for everyday behaviors. Gymnastics coaches, then, should imagine how they\n\nwant to be remembered as a teacher or colleague. Thus, their teaching, interactions, and conduct should support that image. This concept of identifying an end product and “going backwards” is not uncom- mon. It is not unlike exam ining the goals and objec-\n\nBest Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\ntives identified within the curr iculum. All lessons and activities should support, in some way, meeting those objectives. As coaches develop their lessons, their objec- tives, and their curricular activities, they need to judge whether they will contribute to creating the gymnast they envision. It should be relatively easy to identify the type of teacher one wants to be remembered as, and then make the choice that daily behaviors will support this picture. Many organizations create mission or vision statements that are generally examples of the “end product.” Covey suggested writing a per- sonal mission statement. It is important for individuals to identify what is “deeply important” to them selves. That becomes the definition of success or the defini- tion of oneself as the highly effective coach. “What is my vision of myself as a teacher? As a person?” This should become one’s personal creed and standard for behaviors. Ineffective instructors cannot articulate the type of teacher they want to be or the type of gymnast they are trying to create. They work isolated from personal standards. A personal mission statement allows someone to be pro active, because the person has determined his or her direc tion and values. Lives should center on principles, because principles can bring alignment and perspective to other aspects of one’s life."

        "PUT FIRST THINGS FIRST. Habit three is the physical creation, fulfillment, and\n\nactualization of what has been created through habit\ttwo\t(one’s\tper\tsonal,\tprinciple-centered\tmission). Logically then, the first two habits are prerequisites to the third. Habit three focuses on effective self-manage- ment. Individuals must use self-discipline and indepen- dent will to behave accord ing to their principles. This is what compels people to do things that they would rather not do, but know need to be done. Self-disci- pline and independent free will also prevent people from operating on impulse. In other words, one must follow principles and put first things first. Habit three involves identifying and prioritizing short-term and long-term goals. Personal goals should reflect one’s mission, and behaviors are driven by them. Yet, teach ers often face situations that may not fall neatly into their personal goals. Covey explained that situations can be categorized\n\nas urgent or not urgent, and as important or not important. Urgent issues need immediate attention. This could be a message from a parent saying “Call me ASAP!” Important activities generally contribute to one’s mission and values. For example, this could include how a teacher wants to be viewed as a col-\n\n50\n\nleague. Thus, responding to the parent’s message is viewed as urgent, and wanting to maintain a strong working relationship with the parent would be impor- tant. Activities that are both urgent and important (sometimes\tconsidered\tcrises)\tcan\tbe\tall-consuming. If the majority of one’s energy is used to address crisis situations, stress and burnout can result. If most time is spent in crisis manage ment, people have little time and energy to focus on things that are important, but perhaps not urgent. Things that are deemed important often revolve around building relationships. But because the results of one’s attention to these mat- ters may not be immediately visible, and the need to cultivate relationships with colleagues is generally not urgent, people tend to neglect them or put them on the back burner. For teachers, urgent issues arise on a daily basis. A child gets hurt in class or the teacher comes to the gym to find an angry message from a parent. Covey did not suggest ignor ing urgent issues; rather, highly effective coaches also purposely spend their time on activities that are impor tant, especially those that are not urgent and important. This is often difficult. Although being a physically active individual or a good role model for a physically active lifestyle is impor- tant, it is very easy to neglect exercise because of matters that are perceived as urgent. In other words, people sacrifice their workout because physical activ ity is not urgent. However, highly effective people make the time to exercise, because it is important. Highly effective people prioritize these activities and put much effort into them. In other words, they put first things first. Over time, by spending more energy on those things that are not urgent but are important, the number of urgent activities can be decreased. For example, if having collegial relationships is important, and energy is spent by building these relationships, there may be fewer colleague-related crises to which one must respond. Perhaps a coach has been struggling with a particular recreational class teacher in the gym. The class teacher just doesn’t seem to see eye-to -eye on many issues, and the teacher is highly critical of the coach. If the coach nurtures the relationship, the class teacher criticizes him less; there is greater understanding of what he does, and their interac tions become pleasant, because the coach was proactive in developing a posi- tive working relationship. As a result, the coach will find he has to devote less time to responding to misunder- standings or accusations. Besides minimizing crises, one can also create more\n\ntime to tend to important issues by getting better at saying no. By prioritizing and beginning with the end\n\nBest Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nin mind, individu als are better able to say no to things that are not important to them. The ability to say no helps people to say yes to things that support their personal mission. Highly effective people can do this because their habits “become deeply planted in their hearts\tand\tminds”\t(Covey,\t1989,\tp."

        "THINk WIN / WIN. Win/win is a philosophy that one uses to have mu- tually positive interactions with others. In other words, when there are problems that must be solved in the workplace, the “agreements or solutions are mutually beneficial,\tmutually\tsatisfying”\t(Covey,\t1989,\tp. 207)."

    [
        "When everyone feels positively about the resulting decision, they will work harder to support it. It creates a cooperative, rather than competitive, environ ment in which there are no losers; thus, no one succeeds based on someone else’s failure. Win/win is distinctly differ ent from an environment where someone wins and\tsome\tone\tloses\t(win/lose\tor\tlose/win)\tor\twhere\t everyone\tloses\t(lose/lose). A lose/lose situation is severely counterproductive. Here, individuals compete against each other to extremes so that no one can win. Feelings of anger and even revenge can result as the other person is seen as the “enemy.” In fact, people in this situation often lose sight of what they are fighting for, because the energy is focused on the battle. In a gymnastics work environment, win/win means\n\nthat one does not work to compete against other teachers or programs in the gym. For example, in one gym there might be limited use of a certain space that is desired by two coaches. The owner could em ploy a sign-up sheet to schedule use of the space, produc- ing a competitive environment where teachers would literally race to the sheet. This would create a win/lose environment. The competition for space could become so argumentative and negative that a lose/lose situ- ation would result if the owner said, “Fine! I’ll do the assignment of space, regard less of when you want or need the space!” Alternatively, the owner could allot a specific amount of time or days to each teacher\n\n51\n\nwho desired it based on need. Better yet, teachers could work together to determine who might have the highest need on certain days, and decisions would be mutually beneficial - even to the point of the teachers modi fying their schedules to accommodate one another. Clearly, the latter is a win/win situation."

        "Which is best? It depends on the situation."

    [
        "How people answer that question is based largely on the relationships they want to cultivate. If a teacher is rela- tively unconcerned about the issue, but wants to cre- ate or maintain a positive relationship with a co-work- er,\tconceding\tto\tthe\tco-worker\t(a\tlose/win\tsituation)\t might be appropriate. However, if indi viduals strive to always have a win/lose situation in the school set- ting, the relationship with the other person will suffer. On the other hand, in a scenario where a colleague is clearly in the wrong or wanting to do something inappro priate, a win/lose situation is what one might want to create. The win/win scenario seems to be the one that fits most situations, and does not harm relationships with peers, co-workers, or even students. Developing win/win situations is based to a great extent on the first three habits. Without being pro- active about living one’s principles, it is not possible to consider others’ feelings while staying focused on core values. Individuals must have the strength and com- mitment to do what they value as a teacher, without offending or “defeating” a co worker that they must face every day. This consideration for others allows effective coaches to celebrate victories of colleagues, instead of resenting them. It allows people to help others succeed. These behaviors will nurture any rela- tionship. If all parties involved can set aside personal ego and are committed to win/win, one can imagine the possibilities of work that can get done and the be- haviors that are modeled and taught to students. And, with all the positive energy that will exist, there will be little room for negative energy and thinking."

        "SEEk FIRST TO UNDERSTAND, THEN TO BE UNDERSTOOD. This habit deals with empathy and the ability to diagnose before prescribing an answer. Most people are usually more concerned about being understood, without understanding the other person first. Empath- ic listening is listening with the intent to un derstand. Part of how one understands how someone feels is to hear the other person’s words, and watch his or her body language or behaviors. As Covey observed, people learn how to do\n\nthree of the four forms of communication: reading, writing, and speak ing. But the fourth form, listening, is rarely taught. Yet, listening is critical to good communi-\n\nBest Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\ncation. Truly listening to and understanding someone is a relationship-nurturing activity. The more people show they are genuinely listening and understanding, the more the other person is willing to communicate with them. For example, being misunderstood by class teachers is one of the struggles many Team coaches face. The coach may know he is doing the right thing in the gym, yet may be criticized by a particular class teacher because that teacher does not value the teach ing of certain skills. In fact, the class teacher wants her stu- dents to come to gymnastics and just “have fun.” The coach invites her to accom pany her class in the gym, to take part, and to get a more realistic view of what the coach does and is looking for. She fails to do so, and the coach becomes increas ingly frustrated because of her criticism. Finally, they decide to meet after practice one day. The confrontation the coach may have been dreading evolves into an open discussion and “tutor- ing session” of sorts. However, it is not a matter of the coach explaining to the class teacher what actually occurs in the team setting. It turns out that the coach, too, was uneducated about the class teacher’s situa- tion and what she did on a daily basis. Both agree that they will each visit each other’s teaching environment. The class teacher attends team workouts with her class for several sessions, and the coach goes to her rotation during several class periods. In observing her class, the coach begins to understand the challenges she faces: her class is squeezed into a small area of the gym, causing multiple interruptions during the day; her class includes many challenging children whose disrup- tive behaviors are minimized in a movement setting; and she has more students than most teachers in the gym. Together, they develop a plan to relieve some of the stressors they both face. The coach agrees to incorporate play-based activities and to visit her class with more frequency to assist her. She goes to team workouts with her class to get some ideas on new conditioning\tdrills\tand\tlearn\tspotting\t skills\t(which\t may encourage her to more fully engage her stu- dents). They\tdevelop\ta\tpositive\trelationship. The\tcoach\t is no longer angry and bitter with her, and she no longer criticizes the program. Both win and this could not have happened if the coach was not clear on his own principles, yet willing to compromise. Yet it was not until the coach truly understood the class teacher’s situation that he real ized why she was so critical of him. Being understood is also part of this habit, but people\n\nare much more willing to understand a person if they feel the person understood them. Most people have worked with colleagues who are quiet when they are spoken to, not because they are listening, but\n\n52\n\nbecause they are preparing what they are getting ready to say. In this situation the person speak- ing rarely feels understood. Yet, if efforts are made to understand others, they are more likely to do the same. Empathic listening allows one to be understood bet ter, thus increasing one’s circle of influence (described\tear\tlier). Perhaps\tthe\treason\ta\tgym\towner \t and some parents do not support a coach is that they lack understand ing of what the coach is teaching, and they are reverting to their own perceptions of gymnastics training. When people listen empathically and seek to understand another’s perspective, they can better address the issues."

This resembles partici pation on a team, where the energy and momentum created by the team exceeds by far what could be generated by each of the individual members of the team. In teaching, many situations require group participa- tion, such as committee work or departmental tasks. The process can initially feel chaotic and confusing.

They would brainstorm and generate alternatives. Perhaps they could both use the equipment at the same time by creating stations, generating related and sup- porting activi ties that could be done simultaneously, arranging equip ment in new ways, or using nontra- ditional or old equipment to do the same gymnastics skills. In order to synergize, one has to be willing to see\n\nthe different perspectives of others."

Some just refuse, but that should not pre vent individuals from listening empathically, from seeking to understand, from being open to others’ ideas, and from continuing to create posi- tive energy. Covey suggested that the seven habits themselves are synergistic. They are more effective in sum, rather than independently."

        "This is what enables someone to be effective and productive. Taking the time to sharpen the saw is being proactive. If individuals address habit seven, they are giving themselves a greater ability to practice the other habits. The physical dimension is evident to gymnastics instructors because it is what they teach and profess each day to their students. It is about taking care of the body. Adults often say, “I don’t have time to exercise today,” but if they viewed physical activity as a necessity, they would not omit it. Effective individuals take the time to exercise. The spiritual dimension revolves around one’s value sys\ttem\t(habit\t2). It\tis\twhat\tinspires\teach\tperson. Some\t people meditate, some reflect quietly in a peaceful place, some read scripture and pray, others find soli- tude in nature. Working on one’s spiritual dimension often means going back to the personal mission state- ment and seeing life through that vision. One can\n\n53\n\nlogically expect that people who live their core values will be very much “at peace” spiritually. A lot of gymnastics coaches have challenged their mental di mensions by going to college. Most contin- ue to do so by working on advanced degrees on con- tinuing education. Covey pointed out that addressing one’s mental dimension does not require classes. It can be accomplished through any of a number of endeavors, and proactive people find those avenues. Writing and reading can contribute to intel lectual and cultural growth. Serving on a volunteer com mittee can be quite challenging. When coaches learn new activities or drills to teach students, they must research, read, and perhaps learn new skills, all of which are mentally stimulating."
    ],
    [
        "Effective individuals think of what challenges them, and they do it. Covey argued that an individual’s emotional life revolves around relationships. To enhance the social/ emotional di mensions, people must examine their interactions with others and ensure that those interac- tions incorporate habits four, five, and six. The interac- tions do not necessarily have to occur with friends; interactions with co-workers or the gym owner fall within this dimension, as well. Most people have been in situations where they have dreaded a necessary conversation or what might be pre dicted as a confrontation. Perhaps by accident, both people practiced habits four, five, and six. After the conversation, both felt renewed, excited, relieved, and optimistic."
    ],
    [
        "They may not have recognized that they were accommodating their social/emotional dimensions; they just knew that they felt good afterwards. Covey also suggested that one can be rewarded in the social/emotional dimension by service to others. Most people know how personally rewarding it is when they do some thing for someone on a volunteer basis, for\tno\tcompensa\ttion\t(or,\tin\tmany\tcases,\trecognition),\t only because they want to help. Effective people make a conscientious effort to sharpen the saw. They are proactive about taking care of them selves because they know it makes them more productive and positive, while receiving personal satisfaction at the same time. CONCLUSION\n\nAlthough these habits were not written specifically for\n\nGymnastics coaches, they certainly apply. The infor- mation pre sented here does not include all of Covey’s concepts, but it is hoped that it captures the main ideas and suggestions. You are probably thinking that cultivating all these habits will produce no benefit if the people with whom you work do not do the same. Best Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nHowever, as some of the examples have shown, it may not be necessary for the other person to prac- tice each of the habits. Furthermore, by your behaviors you can assist others in practicing the habits. If you listen empathically, the other person is more likely to listen to you. If you seek to understand the other person, they are more willing to try to understand you. Attempting to apply all seven habits at once is not pos sible if you choose to do it correctly. It is best to focus on the first habit, and implement it to some degree before applying the next. In fact, some are prerequi- sites to each other. Practicing habit one means you take charge. Habit two involves the creation of your mission. Habit three is the actualization of your mis- sion. Habit four is the way you should accomplish your mission. Habits five, six, and seven allow you to be effec- tive with others. And habit seven allows you to practice all the other habits better. These habits not only help you become more effec- tive as a colleague in a gym, they help you become more effective as a teacher, a partner, a parent, and a friend. The best start is to recognize that the ability to become an effective gymnastics instructor is in the hands of each person — it is a choice. PAID ADVERTISEMENT\n\nCHAPTER SIX\n\nRisk management\n\nRisk management has always been a key issue for\n\nthe Gymnastics industry to address. However, with recent events surrounding matters related to the insur- ance industry, risk management is now possibly the most important issue facing our industry. Demonstrat- ing good risk management practices is a proven way to reduce Gymnastics-related injury and can also assist in reducing the number of negligence claims made against the sport. Everyone deals constantly with a variety of poten- tial risks on a daily basis. Just by getting into the car to drive somewhere we face the possibility of injury to ourselves or others, and financial loss if we break the law speeding to our destination or if we damage our car. Somehow, among these and other risks, we manage to continue with our lives. Risk is not some- thing we can avoid completely, but it is something we can manage. Risk is not something we even want to eliminate, risk makes life exciting. Hazards, on the other hand, should be eliminated in order to reduce the possibility of catastrophic injury. Participants involved in Gymnastics activities cannot be expected to accept injuries as part of their chosen pastime, and individuals and organizations providing these opportunities must take action to prevent things going wrong. There is an enormous amount of information avail- able on safety, risk management, legal and insurance issues, and the task of developing a risk management plan can seem daunting. Many individuals and orga- nizations choose to ignore the risk and hope that it is something they will never have to deal with. Unfor- tunately, ignorance is not an excuse and this posi- tion could prove costly in the long run. Something as simple as failing to educate the participant of the risk of injury, even though it may be small, could be a breach of duty and place your organization at risk of a negligence claim. A risk is any exposure to potential injury or loss or\n\n55\n\nrisk manaGement\n\ndamage impacting your organization. Risk manage- ment\tis\tsystematically\tidentifying\tthreats\t(risks)\tof\tinjury\t in your organization and developing ways to minimize those occurring. You are likely already practicing risk management to some degree, but it is important that you formalize what you do. Risk management involves developing policies, systems, and procedures. You cannot eliminate risks completely, but you can manage them appropriately and educate your staff about them. Risk management and education needs to become a part of the culture of your organization rather than being seen as something separate. Even if the process used is informal, it should be documented and based on a known system. Risks can generally be grouped under four headings:\n\n1. Physical – injury or damage to persons or property 2. Legal – breaching legal obligations 3. Moral / Ethical – harm to your organization’s repu- tation\n\n4. Financial – loss of assets of the organization\n\nSome examples of risks include:\n\nInsufficient\tqualification\tof\tstaff •\t Apparatus\tand\tEquipment\tfailure •\t Attracting\ttoo\tmany\tparticipants\tfor\tan\tevent •\t Discrimination\tor\tharassment •\t Injury\tto\ta\tstaff\tmember,\tspectator\tor\tparticipant •\t Negative\tpublicity •\t Damage\tto\tthe\tenvironment •\t Loss\tof\tproperty\tor\ttheft •\t Unsupervised\tactivities\n\nHow do you manage risk? There are four main sections in risk management: identification, education, assessment, and treatment. A safety and risk management audit can assist you to work through these stages by following a simple 10- step process to developing a risk management plan. Best Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nIn summary, the 10 steps to develop a risk management plan are:\n\n1. Make a commitment as an organization to risk management. 2. Identify all hazards and possible risks. 3. Assess the level of each risk. 4. Decide to accept or manage each risk. 5. Determine management options for all unacceptable risks. 6. Formalize your risk manage-\n\nment action plan. 7. Implement your manage- ment options. 8. Communicate informa- tion to everyone affected. 9. Review your risk manage- ment action plan on a regular basis. 10. Identify any new risks and update your plan\n\nAudits are useful tools as a starting point to identify risks. However they are not definitive and each organization will have issues that are specific to them that must be considered. An example of the sorts of questions you might find in an audit include:\n\nDoes\tyour\tBoard\tor\tstaff\tmeet\tregularly\twith\tall decisions and actions documented? Is\tthe\tannual\treport\tor\tmeeting\tminutes\tcirculated to all members? Are\tall\tfinancial\ttransactions\taccurately\trecorded? •\t Does\tthe\torganization\thave\tthe\tfollowing\tin- surance coverage - public liability, professional indemnity and director’s and officer’s liability? •\t Are\tyour\trules,\tby-laws\tand\tpractices\tnon-discrimi-\n\nnatory?

Is\tthere\ta\tclear\tprocedure\tfor\treporting\tincidents, accidents and injuries? 56\n\nUSA GYMNASTICS SAFETY AND RISk MANAGEMENT\n\nUSA Gymnastics offers a Safety/Risk Management\n\ncertification course that is continually updated and available online or as part of a live workshop. The\n\nprimary goal of this course is to emphasize the importance of risk management as part of an overall safety program. The\n\ncourse has been designed for a va- riety of audiences - gymnastics coaches, teachers, instructors,\n\nclub owners, meet direc- tors, judges, athletes and others. The course covers risk management; envi- ronmental, program and legal factors; sports injury care and special gymnastics safety factors. The course addresses the two basic areas\n\nof risk in gymnastics - risk of injury, which is the primary risk, and risk of a lawsuit. Safety Certifi-\n\ncation helps better prepare the gym-\n\nnastics professional to be more vigilant and\n\nmore likely to foresee potential problems. Certification appears to reduce the incidence of catastrophic injuries and enhances professionalism. Use the USA Gymnastics website at www.usa-gymnastics.org to register for an online course or find a live workshop near you. Suggested duties: The laws pertaining to voluntary participation in hazardous activities vary from state to state.

A very effective way to manage risk as it pertains to equipment and apparatus is to understand that even “heavy duty” gymnastics equipment has a life expectancy and will not last forever. Mats wear out and become unstably soft or lose their uniformity; metal can experience stress and fatigue and will eventually expire; wood and wood laminate is subject to environmental factors such as humidity and ultraviolet light and will wear out. Have a program of replac- ing equipment on an amortized scheduled basis. Having new and state-of-the-art equipment does not eliminate risk but can substantially reduce the possibility of apparatus failure and the hazards associated with old, worn equipment. An effective way to prepare and plan for equipment\n\nreplacement is to conduct an extensive equipment audit that focuses on the date of purchase and life- expectancy of every piece of apparatus and mat in the gym. This audit needs to take place just one time but will\tneed\tto\tbe\tupdated\tand\tmaintained\tas\tnew\t(or\t used)\tequipment\tis\tpurchased\tor\tbrought\tinto\tuse."

There are also disinfectant sprays that do not have all the harmful chemicals that other products have. For instance, Sol-U-Guard Botanical does not use chemicals in their product. They only use natural germ busting plants to elimi- nate bacteria. Best Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nThere is no easy way to clean porous surfaces such as the gymnastic floor, foam pits, and the vault runway. A light coat of disinfectant spray can help kill some of the bacteria on the surface of these pieces of equipment. However, the best thing to do to prevent MRSA is to wash your hands during competition or practice and shower immediately afterwards. that they are aware of the risks of their participation; this is typically done through consent forms and waiv- ers.

Participant considerations\n\nThe laws pertaining to participation in hazardous activities vary from state to state but some responsibili- ties are universal. There are inherent risks involved in the participation in gymnastics activities; participants should be educated about these risks. Participants have the right to not be exposed to hazardous con- ditions; the operator of a dangerous activity has a responsibility to provide a safe environment for their participants. Generally, a participant accepts responsi- bility for their involvement in a dangerous activity by agreeing to accept responsibility and acknowledging\n\nAll\tparticipants\t(or\ttheir\tparent/guardian)\tshould\tbe\t required to acknowledge the risks of participation and agree to abide by the rules of participation by signing a waiver and release form. Participants should also agree to allow medical treatment, if it becomes necessary, by signing a “consent to treatment” form. Participants should acknowledge their readiness / preparedness to engage in gymnastics activities by completing and sign- ing a medical history survey. Gymnastics professionals must understand that a participant is least at risk when they are fully prepared to perform the skill being asked of them. A participant should be mentally ready to perform by fully under- standing the skill and cognitively aware of what is expected. A participant must also be physically ready to perform by being strong enough, flexible enough, powerful enough, fast enough and generally physically able to perform the skill. The participant must also be emotionally ready to perform by being prepared on a psychological level – not overly confident, not overly fearful and focused on the task. This performer readi- ness model is graphically depicted in the PROGRAM Chapter as the Gymnastics TRY-Angle. A gymnast that is mentally and physically able to accomplish the skill and has the emotional foundation to perform will be concentrating on the task and typically tries harder. This ultimately leads to a greater chance of successfully completing the skill and therefore less likely at risk of failure and injury.

        "If you see an unsafe situation, you have the responsibility to correct it. If you observe another teacher that may need a little “help” please be considerate of their feelings and treat them like the professional that they are. Talk to your co-worker privately if you have a suggestion. Never criticize or complain in front of a class. kEEP YOUR STUDENTS IN LINE – Use hoops, carpet squares, ropes, ladders, etc. to help keep the kids in order. Tell them exactly where you want them to go. Whenever groups are in the hallway, they are to be kept in line, quiet and absolutely not running. Leaders should be in close proximity of the line or group and children must always be within staff’s field of vision. ROTATIONS – Moving from place to place is often our biggest problem. Do not let your class “break” and run through the gymnastics center to get a drink or move to the next event. Move your class together in a straight line, teaching them the importance of watch- ing out for the other groups. Be particularly aware of public areas. USE LOTS OF CHOICES – Keep the children busy by setting up extra activity stations. Set up the stations so that there is no confusion as to where to go. Make it perfectly clear what you want them to work on."

        "kEEP IT CALM – Discipline is one of our objectives. Teach your students to use “inside voices” and explain to them “personal space”. Refrain from raising your own voice and you will probably see your kids staying quieter. Do not yell across the room. It is sometimes necessary to stop your class if things get crazy and out of hand. Have everyone sit down and relax a bit to change the mood and energy level. Change activities or use the time for a little group instruction."

        "Stay in control of your class. FIELD TRIPS – While at the vault, the bars or the water cooler, children are to be kept under the supervi- sion of staff and not allowed to wander around unless accompanied by staff. Always have a first aid kit and communication system available."

If staff must handle such an injury they must be required to wear rubber gloves, provided with the first aid kit. Staff members are not to administer any first aid unless it is an emergency. If a child has a blister or a rip and it can be treated with a band aid or piece of gauze and some tape, it is okay.

Additional Action Plan Considerations Minor Incident A minor incident is one that does not require initia- tion of the emergency medical procedures. Examples include simple first aid for minor cuts and scratches. Incidents more complicated than this should be han- dled as major incidents until a qualified and trained individual can assess the situation and reclassify the incident as minor. Medical Emergency When a medical emergency occurs:\n\n1. Conduct a primary survey of the area. Make sure it is safe to approach the victim without causing more\tharm\tor\tplacing\tothers\t(including\tyou)\tin\t danger. 2. Initiate the emergency medical procedures and follow First Aid standards: Check – Call – Care accompanied by A, B, C’s. Examine the injured person(s)\tto\tdiscover\tthe\tmain\tproblems\t(i.e. chok- ing, not breathing, bleeding, burned, laceration, chest\tpain,\textremely\thot,\tetc.). Best Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\n3. Call 911 for immediate assistance and instruct another staff member to meet the emergency responders. 4. Medical Treatment: Full medical emergencies are best handled by dialing 911 and providing basic first aid until the fire department or paramedics arrive. Under certain circumstances such as large disasters, assistance from the fire department or paramedics may not be immediately available. If immediate medical assistance is required, take the person(s)\tto\tone\tof\tthe\tfollowing\tfacilities:\n\nEMERGENCY\t-\t911 \t •\tLOCAL\tHOSPITAL\tor\tCLINIC\t- \t •\tPOISON\tCONTROL\tCENTER\t- \t •\tGYM\tOWNER\t-\n\nIn the event of a hard fall or an obvious cata- strophic injury, specific steps must be followed, such as the following:\n\n1. Do not panic. 2. Follow all first aid training guidelines including rescue breathing and CPR if necessary. 3. The leader of the class in which the child gets hurt is in charge of the first aid treatment of that child until care is transferred to a more qualified caregiver. Stay with the injured child. 4."

Incident / Accident Reports\n\nAn incident report form can be a helpful tool to document information about incidents, accidents, or injuries in your facility. Consult with your legal counsel and insurance company regarding their use and the type of information to include. In the case of a major incident, contact your legal counsel and insurance company immediately. They will help to direct you as to post-incident steps. All information regarding the injured person and any\n\nwitnesses is strictly confidential. For your own protec- tion, do not discuss any accident with anyone other than the coordinator or the owner. A notification should be made informing the parent that an incident has occurred requiring treatment.

        "Add the dimension of dealing with the media, and your task becomes even more challenging. Whether or not you like the idea of contending with reporters, cameras, and microphones, you may need to. Having a “media strategy” in mind before a crisis will help you. Reporters are trained and educated in their field just as you are in your profession. Accept their right to ask questions to keep the public informed. If you provide a reporter with background information and answer questions clearly and truthfully, the reporter will make every effort to be fair. Tough questions don’t trip people up. Sloppy answers to easy questions are what do people in. Be aware, however, that even the most effective media relations plan won’t always result in favorable press. Expect to be on the receiving end of criticism occasionally. Nothing is 100 percent off the re- cord. “I don’t know, but I will find out and get back to you before your deadline” is an infinitely better thing to say to a reporter than making up facts that don’t turn out to be true. Notes are made and reviewed by editors, publishers and lawyers. Contact Your Insurer\n\nThe first step in any crisis is to report the incident to your insurance agent immediately, no matter the sever- ity of the claim. If the claim has the potential to catch the media’s attention, it’s important that you have early contact with your insurance company. While contacting your agent and / or insurance\n\ncompany is the ideal first step, it’s not always possible. A story comes to light, the media runs with it. An accident occurs; a photographer arrives on the scene with a camera. Sometimes the media will be at your door or on your phone before you are able to talk with your insurance company. In this scenario, you’ll need to develop a carefully controlled message sent through one spokesperson. There are some key tips to dealing with the media in a crisis:\n\nBE\tPREPARED\n\nUnderstand\tthat\tthe\tmedia\tneeds\ta\tstory...let\tit be a controlled, child-focused story that will help restore the public’s confidence in how you treat\n\n75\n\nthe safety and security of the children. Take a deep breath, refer to your positive points and talk to the reporter about YOUR gym! Designate\tone\tperson\tin\tyour\torganization\tto speak to the media. The spokesperson should be articulate, diplomatic, and sincere. Your spokes- person, in essence, becomes the “voice” of your business on the television, in the newspaper, and over the airwaves. If that person appears caring and concerned, your organization will be per- ceived as such. If possible, individual personnel should not speak with the media. Have a back-up plan in case this designated person is unavailable. Be sure to tell all of your staff who these people are and how to contact them when the media calls! Anticipate\tquestions\treporters\twill\task. Determine\t ahead of time what you will say and what you won’t or can’t say. Have fact sheets prepared. Prepare a written statement for distribution with the help of your attorney. Be sure to share this information with your staff."

        "Emphasize key points made in the news release, and don’t deviate from them. Develop\ta\tresponse\tother\tthan\t“no\tcomment.”\t If a criminal act has allegedly occurred, as in the case of child abuse, issue a brief statement like this: “The safety and well-being of our youth are extremely important to us. We are cooperating with the authorities in their investigation, and any comments made before the investigation is complete would be premature.”\n\nAvoid\textremes. Do\tnot\tdefend\tyourself\ttoo strenuously, appearing too eager to avoid blame. Do not lock yourself in your office, appearing to avoid responsibility. Maintain\tan\topen\tmind\tand\ta\tgood\tattitude\tabout\t dealing with the media. Much of the time these professionals want to work with you, not against you. Your comfort level or attitude toward the media could influence the treatment you receive. Announce\tthat\tyou\ttake\tthe\tproblem\tseriously. Then take it seriously, even if you think the issue is non-existent or overblown. Whether it was a real problem before, it certainly is a reputation management issue now that the press has it. Best Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nDon’t\tlie. If\tyou\t(or\tyour\tstaff)\tscrewed\tup,\tadmit\t it. The media is relatively kinder to those who openly admit they screwed up. It’s disarming. Although they may not become your friend, they will at least realize that you have a conscience. That realization alone can be the difference between a hostile story and one that respects the sometimes-complicated choices we all make when performing our duties. After\texperiencing\ta\tdisaster\tit\tis\tvital\tthat\ta\tthor- ough review is undertaken of how the organiza- tion responded and coped with the emergency. Lessons can always be learned and these will not only improve the response should there be anoth- er incident, but could prevent a future disaster. It therefore makes sense to be sure to let the media know what you did in analyzing the situation and improving the response to avoid any future crisis. Probably the best defense against negative publicity\n\nis a strong, positive relationship with the local report- ers before anything “bad” occurs. If an incident occurs that could cause you and your organization grief, be prepared with ready answers to probable questions and a couple of choice sound bytes that will look good in the paper or sound good when quoted. EMPLOYER RISk MANAGEMENT\n\nWhen a gymnastics coach hears the words “safety”\n\nand “risk management,” they probably think about things like spotting, teaching progressions, safety certification and medical insurance. A gym owner may think about things like coach’s certifications, liabil- ity and worker compensation insurance and maybe equipment and facility inspections. One aspect of risk management that typically does not get enough atten- tion by gym owners is managing the risk of being an employer. Workplace risk includes safety and litigation risk. Though the actual responsibilities of being an employer vary by state and are governed by legislation and numerous\tagencies\t(including\tthe\tAmericans\twith\tDis- abilities Act, Occupational Safety and Health Adminis- tration, Fair Labor Standards, Family and Medical Leave Act, Department of Labor, National Labor Relations Board, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, etc.),\tthere\tare\tsome\tcustomary\tworkplace\twrongdo- ings that require our attention. Harassment. Harassment can include hostile work\tenvironment\tor\tquid\tpro\tquo\t(exchange\tfor\t privileged\ttreatment)\tsexual\tharassment. Sexual\t and other forms of harassment is a common\n\n76\n\nproblem. Over 16,000 cases are brought each year\tagainst\temployers\t(US\tDepartment\tof\tLabor). Claims can be created by men, women, co- workers, managers, customers, parents, students, owners, vendors, contractors and others."

        "Workplace violence. Although gymnastics may not be considered at “high risk” for potential vio- lence, the welfare of others and your own safety are at stake. Workplace violence accounts for 2 million physical attacks and 6 million threatened attacks each year in America. Thirty five percent of all\tviolent\tcrime\toccurs\tat\tthe\tjob\tsite\t(The\tAGOS\t Group;\t1999,\t2000). Theft. Embezzlement includes taking money from the cash register, making personal copies without authorization, billing personal phone calls to the organization, running personal errands on organization time and other forms of fraud. Theft by employees costs the American economy an estimated $30 billion each year. Discrimination. Are you an Equal Opportunity Em- ployer? Federal law prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age or disability. Have you identified the essential func- tions of the jobs you hire for and what “reasonable accommodations” you could provide in order to be in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act?

        "The only people that really enjoy lawsuits are lawyers. Remember that everyone has access to a lawyer and when a lawyer’s telephone rings, it rings with a “cha-ching” rather than a “ring-ring.” Law- yers are always looking for opportunities for work. Don’t’ be a victim of an employee lawsuit that could ruin your business and your reputation. Most small organizations cannot bear the expense of a single successful claim against them. Even if you win the lawsuit, you lose; your valuable time is wasted, your attention to your business is disrupted, your credibility is impugned, staff morale is affected and your insur- ance premiums could be impacted. Be prepared. In order to properly deal with these\n\nissues and avoid a lawsuit, there are some recom- mended guidelines for employers to follow. The first defensive measure an employer can take to avoid a legal action is to conduct thorough background checks of all applicants. Follow up on all references, watch for employment gaps and other “red flags.” Negligent hiring or negligent retention places you at risk of a legal claim. Gym owners should also offer and require ongoing training to his/her employees. A set of reporting standards should be established. A “zero-tolerance” policy for any violation of practices or procedures should also be enforced. Even though this no tolerance policy is imperative, an atmosphere of open communication and empathy must exist in the organization. An employee should be able to feel that their concerns are important to their employer and will be dealt with appropriately."

If may be no fun to send home that exposure notice but it is the right thing to do and understanding parents will ultimately respect you for it. ERGONOMICS FOR COACHES\n\nChronic back pain, sore shoulders, strained knees, tender wrists, elbow pain… Sound like a checklist of injuries for our National Team? Fortunately it is not. Unfortunately, it is a checklist of common ailments to Gymnastics coaches. The number one cause of workplace fatalities is slips and falls. OSHA safety studies show that back injuries are the primary cause of many lost workdays. Nearly 18% of the lost work time for employees in 1990 was due to chronic back pain. Back problems can result in pain, lost work time, inconvenience, and possible disability. The back is the most injury-prone part of the body. Almost everyone will suffer back pain at some time in his or her life. Gymnastics coaches are inherent- ly at risk for back injuries. Can you afford to be out of work due to a bad back? Can your gym afford to lose a valuable employee to an injury? Preventing back injury is much easier than correcting or healing a back injury. At work or play, we are likely to push our bodies past their capacity by doing the same action over and over. With camp season soon upon us, think about the number of kips you could end up spotting in a week. Over time, improper lifting practices cause fatigue and pain that can lead to structural problems in the spine and to back injuries. Gymnastics coaches must learn and practice correct lifting techniques and foster back and muscle health. Use good body mechanics while spotting:\n\nLift\twith\tthe\tgymnast\tas\tclose\tto\tyou\tas\tpossible. The load on the spine increases as the distance away from the spine increases.

If there is too much space between your back and the wall, i.e., if you can easily move your hands back and forth, you may need to correct your posture. Corrective Exercise: Wall Exercise: Stand with back against the wall, heels about 3 inches from the wall. Place hands up beside head with elbows touching wall. If needed, correct feet and knees, then tilt pelvis to flatten low back against wall by pulling up and in with the lower abdominal muscles. Keeping arms in contact with wall, move arms slowly to a diagonally overhead position. (Hold\tseveral\tseconds\tand\trepeat\t5\tto\t8\t times.)\n\nCheck\tyour\thamstring\tlength.

Keep one knee bent and straighten the other leg. Be sure to keep the pelvis in a neutral position - do not slump or excessively arch the low back. Pull the ankle into dorsiflexion to stretch the gastrocne- mius\t(calf)\tmuscles\tthat\toriginate\tabove\tthe\tknee. Hold several seconds and repeat 5 to 8 times, alternating legs. Elbow, wrist, and hand injuries also account for lost work time. I doubt I am the only coach to ever suffer a jammed thumb from improper placement of my hand while spotting aerials. Repetitive spotting of hand- springs can place an enormous amount of stress and strain on sensitive soft tissues. Ergonomics can help physically position you in your workspace to reduce stress, strain, and fatigue. Learn and practice easy, effective, and inexpensive things you can do right now to reduce your risk of injury. By doing so, you will also increase your productivity. With improved ergonom- ics, you will reduce your risk of injuries or discomforts related to repetitive strain injuries.

Proper positions and technique is essential to helping\n\nprevent injuries due to cumulative trauma from repeti- tive tasks such as spotting. The costs of teaching your coaches how to protect themselves against injuries such as Cumulative Trauma Disorders can be expensive. But the costs of not making that investment are much higher—and sometimes ruinous. Employers often must pay for medical treatment or workers´ compensation for employees injured by repetitive work. In extreme cases, workers with serious workplace-related cumula- tive trauma injuries have sued their employers under OSHA\tregulation\t51(a),\twhich\trequires\temployers\tto\t provide a safe environment for their employees. The hidden costs of cumulative trauma injuries are even more damaging. In fact, experts estimate that the hidden costs of cumulative trauma injuries are two to seven times as great as the visible costs. Avoidable inju- ries such as carpal tunnel syndrome and back strain cut into workers´ productivity, sometimes forcing employ- ees to miss work or change careers altogether. In these times of near 3% unemployment, who among us can afford to lose coaches and instructors? Before your employees complain of sore forearms or wrists or lower back pain, invest in their as well as your future. Think of it as an investment in your employees."

        "Not even close. Providing a gym is a responsibility that will last as long as the business does. Such care requires constant maintenance and vigilance. And to do it properly, gym owners must dedicate more employee attention to the equipment. It’s not that hard, but most gym owners/ coaches still don’t want to do it. They don’t have the time or inclination. A dangerous gym, however, can end up costing more\n\nthan just a few man-hours. In today’s litigious society, gym owners often find themselves the focus of law- suits. The best way to avoid legal headaches, of course, is to prevent them. Here are a few steps to keeping a safe gym."

        "You should always double check to ensure your facility has the safest flow and arrangement possible. Bars, without question, should demand your great- est attention in this area because they are the piece of equipment most likely to cause injury due to flying bodies. Next to floor exercise, due to the size of the apparatus, including the support cables and dismount areas needed; bars require the most space available. All apparatus should be positioned in a logical way to\n\navoid distractive traffic nearby; if your gym classes ro- tate from event to event, it makes sense to design your gym with the layout that minimizes the cross traffic as the students move. When picking a design for the building, be mindful of traffic patterns and place the restrooms on the near side\tof\tthe\tgym\t(close\tto\tthe\tviewing\tareas)\tso\teveryone\t who needs to use them can avoid crossing busy areas. 2. Mats\n\nFind an injured child in a gym, and chances are they\n\nhurt themselves falling off the equipment. Certainly injuries can occur hitting the apparatus but roughly 60 percent of all injuries result from a fall from apparatus. Gym owners can greatly reduce the chances of injury\n\nwith various types of appropriate landing surfaces. Be it a loose-foam pit, a resi-pit, a sting mat, landing mat or ethafoam tumbling surface; match the matting to the\tskill\tbeing\tattempted\t(remember\tthat\tevery\tskill\t should be considered as “being attempted” rather than “being performed” to help you think about the risks involved)\tand\tthe\tapparatus. Best Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nGym caretakers should check the entire area regularly to ensure it is properly matted. Heavy activity never fails to cause shifting, leaving dangerous gaps and overlaps that create hazards to falling children. Manufacturers also should provide testing results to indicate the proper impact attenuation of the mat and the life expectancy of the materials. Replace mats before they become a hazard. Experts recommend that all mats be inspected regu-\n\nlarly. They must be checked for rips and tears in the cover, worn soft spots, uneven wear, etc. Make sure that all inspections are documented and recorded for use in the event of a lawsuit. 3. Maintaining Equipment and Apparatus Pits and mats obviously aren’t the only area requiring a dedicated maintenance schedule. The equipment and apparatus also need constant attention. On bars, for example, all spin locks and cables should\n\nbe checked regularly. Staff also should scrutinize bolts for severe wear, floor plates for proper connections and deterioration of bar rail bearings. When is the last time you checked the load bearing connections on the ring rig or took a close look at the spotting belt pulleys? Gym owners should ensure their employees regularly inspect the apparatus for flaws. The maintenance plan should include everything from mundane chores such as tightening up loose connections to more critical ex- aminations of bolts, welding points and moving parts. Experts recommend daily inspections, though many concede it would be impossible given the circumstanc- es in most gyms. However, the only way any examina- tion systems will work is if they become a top priority. Gym owners need to show their coaches they’re com- mitted to the idea by carving time out of busy work- days for inspections. As always, keep a written record of your mainte- nance program. Proper maintenance isn’t that difficult and the equipment just may last longer! Finally, all equipment has a life expectancy; wood deteriorates, metal fatigues and mats get soft. When apparatus gets old, replace it."

        "82\n\n4. Age Appropriate Skills\n\nSimply put, children need to act their age; not so simply, coaches need to remember that. Coaches often can get carried away, especially as time goes on, in the thought that the earlier a skill is taught to a gymnast, the better. The majority of preschool-age children injured in gyms last year were on equipment designed for older children. In many cases, the bar rails were too large for a small child to grip or equipment was too high or too far apart for the children to reach. In other instances, the apparatus required strength or coordination not possessed by someone younger than five years of age. Preschool-age children need to be allowed to explore the limits of their physical abilities in a safe environ- ment. School-age children, on the other hand, should be exposed to skills but only in a logical, progressive way. Make sure that skills are mastered before allowing the gymnast to attempt more advanced skills. Even elite athletes must learn to walk before they can run. Lesson planning with a solid curriculum of progres-\n\nsions is the only way to maintain safety in teaching gymnastic skills. It’s up to you\n\nThere are many great safety and risk management re-\n\nsources\tavailable\t(one\tof\tthe\tbest\tbeing\tthe\tUSA\tGym- nastics\tRisk\tManagement\thandbook)\tbut\tultimately,\tit\tis\t up to YOU. Now that you’ve designed a safe gym, equipped it properly, dedicated your resources to minimize injuries, there’s still one last chore. You must create the culture of safety in your gym. Experts encourage gym own- ers to be aware of ever-changing situations. Follow established guidelines, monitor modifications, adjust equipment accordingly, prepare your staff and reduce the possibility of successful lawsuits. The best way to monitor and manage the risk of\n\ngymnastics is to keep it safe. Best Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nCHAPTER SEvEN\n\nUSA GYMNASTICS PROGRAMS\n\nUSA Gymnastics is the sole national governing body (NGB)\tfor\tthe\tsport\tof\tgymnastics\tin\tthe\tUnited\tStates. It gets this designation from the International Olympic Committee and the International Gymnastics Federa- tion. USA Gymnastics sets the rules and policies that govern gymnastics in this country. Training and select- ing the U.S. Gymnastics Teams for the Olympics and World Championships are just two of the many respon- sibilities of USA Gymnastics. The not-for-profit organization was established in Tucson, Ariz., in 1963. During the mid-1960s the U.S. had scarcely 7,000 athletes competing a limited schedule. The only major international events for gym- nasts were the Olympic Games and the Pan American Games. Today, more than 90,000 athletes are registered in competitive programs through USA Gymnastics. USA Gymnastics has more than 15,000 professional and instructor members. Approximately 3,000 competitions and events throughout the U.S. are sanctioned annu- ally. USA Gymnastics is headquartered in Indianapolis, Ind., with several other sports’ NGBs and has expanded very quickly in its 30 plus years. The original staff of three has grown to approximately 40 employees main- taining the following areas:\n\nProgram Departments\n\nThis area consists of Acrobatic Gymnastics, Group\n\nGymnastics, Men’s Artistic Gymnastics, Rhythmic Gymnastics, Trampoline & Tumbling, and Women’s Artistic Gymnastics programs. They are responsible for all aspects of athlete, coach and official selection and development. This includes conducting clinics, train- ing camps and competitions; coordinating gymnastics delegations to national and international competitions; and providing support for the athletes and coaches who represent the United States here and abroad. Many different gymnastics plans are developed for all\n\nages and skill levels from grassroots to advanced. The\n\n83\n\nGymnastics ProGramminG\n\nprograms generate compulsory exercises for develop- ing gymnasts and rule books for registered athletes, coaches and clubs. Member Services\n\nMember Services offers a variety of membership programs to all corners of the gymnastics community including\tgymnasts\t(both\tcompetitive\tand\trecreational),\t coaches, judges, instructors, clubs, parents, fans and gymnastics related businesses. Currently, over 100,000 individuals are USA Gymnastics members. For more information about each program’s benefits and how to apply, visit our web site at www.usa-gymnastics.org or call Member Services at 1-800-345-4719. Events\n\nThis department annually conducts and produces five to six nationally televised events including national championships and international invitationals. This includes all aspects of the event from site selection to venue staging and production of the entire competi- tion. Also, this department arranges delegation travel and housing and tends to the needs of USA Gymnas- tics’ national and international guests. Marketing\n\nThe marketing department encompasses the ar- eas of communications, corporate sponsorships, and television sales. The department’s goal is to generate exposure for gymnastics to the public and recognition for USA Gymnastics’ corporate partners. Communications\n\nThrough the media and public relations efforts, this department strives to increase the public’s awareness of USA Gymnastics and its athletes, coaches, events, and programs. The department also provides information to USA\n\nGymnastics Online, which can be viewed at: www.usa-gymnastics.org. Best Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nUSA Gymnastics publications produces two maga- zines including USA Gymnastics, a bi-monthly, four color publication geared toward the athlete, coach and gymnastics enthusiast, and Technique magazine, a technical publication designed for professional mem- bers of the sport. Technique, a black and white publica- tion, is published 10 times per year. In addition, the publications area produces media guides, newsletters, event programs, reports, the Congress Proceedings Book and other promotional items used to generate exposure for the sport."

Each National Team Member works his/her way through a structured system of competi- tion. U.S. men’s team members are mostly products of private clubs or collegiate gymnastics programs while most of the U.S. women’s and rhythmic team members come from private clubs and organizations. Every potential Olympian must win a place on the National Team through a selection process. This process is supervised by USA Gymnastics, the umbrella orga- nization composed of 22 Constituent Organizations which are the back-bone of gymnastics in the U.S., and helps participants advance from the grassroots to the Olympic level.

It happens many times a day all across the country. A parent will call their local gymnastics club and ask ques- tions about the program. The parents often say some- thing like, “I don’t really want my child to be a gymnast but it would be nice if they could learn a cartwheel; I just think it would be really good for them.” The ques- tions these parents have about the gymnastics program are typically, “How much does it cost?” “When are the classes?” and “What will they learn?” Answering these questions can be an involved process. The cost per les- son is a few dollars. Classes are held at certain times on certain days. What a child learns in gymnastics can take more time to explain. Sure those gymnastics teachers are helping their young athletes learn cartwheels and back handsprings. Coaches are spotting giants and full twists but what else is being learned? The parent who states that they think “…gymnas- tics would probably be good for their child” might be surprised to know just how good it is. With pediatric obesity at an epidemic level of 13% of children and adolescents in the United States, getting children away from the television or computer games and into the gym is a terrific first step toward a healthy lifestyle. The researchers at the Centers for Disease Control report that youth who undertake lifestyle exercise programs that increase physical activity, reduce the intake of high-caloric foods and involve parents have the best chance of preventing and reducing obesity over the long-term. Gymnastics is perhaps one of the most comprehensive “lifestyle exercise programs” available to children, incorporating strength, flexibility, speed, balance, coordination, power and discipline.

Adults do this by teaching youth positive skills, attitudes and behaviors called “developmental assets.” Just as financial assets allow a person to weather difficult times and to plan for a positive future, “developmental assets” provide the emotional resources youth need to avoid problems and to be successful. Research by the Search Institute (Copyright\t©\t1996\tby\tSearch\tInstitute,\tMinneapolis,\t Minnesota;\t1-800-888-7828. All\trights\treserved)\thas\t identified 40 assets that are essential for youth to blos- som into productive citizens. The more assets a young person has, the more likely he or she is to succeed in school, stay healthy, and volunteer in the community. The fewer assets available to a youth, the more likely he or she is to try alcohol or drugs, commit a crime, or do poorly in school. Parents, teachers, coaches, faith communities, business leaders, everyone, can help build assets in our youth. In fact, we need everyone to\n\nBest Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nwork together to create the kind of community where all youth thrive. Coaches have a unique and powerful role to play in building assets in young people. They can be the adults to whom youth turn for advice. They can model responsible, caring interactions with others. They can motivate youth to achieve new goals. A coach can make all the difference in the world to a young per- son...especially a young person who doesn’t have many assets to begin with. Ten ways coaches can build assets every day\n\n1. Ask youth for their ideas and listen, really listen, to their responses. 2. Give youth tasks and responsibilities they can handle. 3. Tell a youth what he or she is doing right twice as often as you point out mistakes. 4. Talk to athletes, other coaches, parents and officials with respect. 5. Show interest in youth beyond what he\n\nor she can do in the gym or on the playing field / court. 6."

The “implied pressure to learn” in- evitably presents a skill-based, results-oriented program that manifests in the preadolescent years with the “I can’t” or “I don’t care” attitude.

A lesson plan organizes what you will do and say in class. The amount of detail in a written lesson plan de- pends upon the complexity of the lesson and upon your own experience and back- ground. A good lesson does not guarantee good teaching, but without a plan, the chances for success are greatly diminished. In general, beginning practice teachers find it helpful to write out their lesson plans in detail, whereas more experience might require fewer details. One of the other advantages of a written lesson plan is your ability to refer to it while you are teaching the lesson. Learning Objectives\n\nIn considering your goals, think about how the lesson\n\nfits into the sequence of learning and the long-term needs of the student. Objectives are critical guidelines. If your teaching objective is Beam mounts, it is not very helpful to write your objective as “To learn beam mounts.” This is merely writing your goal in the form of a phrase or sentence. The most common way to write objectives is in terms of student activities such as “Students will demonstrate an ability to perform three different beam mounts correctly at least eight times out of 10.” Objectives require you to clearly and concisely identify the key points or understanding you expect your students to learn. Best Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nWhen writing learning objectives:\n\nThink\tof\tyour\tobjective\tin\tterms\tof\t\"What\tmust the students learn in this lesson?\"\n\nWrite\tout\tthe\tanswer\tto\tthis\tquestion\tin\ta\tstraight- forward meaningful simple sentence. In\tyour\tplanning,\tkeep\tyour\tobjective\t(what\tthe student\tmust\tlearn)\tseparate\tfrom\twhat\tstudents\t do\t(activities\tand/or\tprocedures)\tin\tyour\tlesson\t plan. Remember that good teaching is a reflection of good planning. Writing down your thoughts beforehand clar- ifies your lesson. Remember that even you know your subject or have taught it before; you have a legal duty to properly plan your activity. If you ask a contractor to build a house, you expect that person to show you a blueprint written house plan, even though he may have built hundreds of houses. Students and parents have the right to have similar expectations of the teachers."

The\taction\tplan\t(introduction,\t procedures/activities,\tkey\tpoints,\tclosure)\tidentifies\tthe\t steps you will take to help our students learn. Action Plan\n\nA good lesson action plan includes and introduction, specific\tactivities,\tkey\tpoints\t(learning\thighlights)\tand\ta\t closure. For the introduction, review the previous lesson that led up to this lesson, give directions and let the students know your expectations, giving an overview of what is going to happen, tell students the main learn- ing principle you expect them to learn. The next step in your action plan is to identify the materials you will need to teach the lesson. Try to be as well-prepared in regard to mats, equipment and sup- plies for setting up circuits, stations and drills. While many teachers attempt to prepare lesson plans\n\nand conduct their teaching using a written plan, most of the plans focus on the specific activities. This is only the beginning. Be sure to write down every drill, every station, and every circuit assignment including detailed expectations of every activity. Use a timeline/schedule. In the action plan is where a teacher can detail the specific ways they plan to conduct the actual lesson. Alternative activities should be listed for those students that are just beginning or lack the ability to perform the skill being worked. Optional activities for those students that have mastered the skill being worked on should also be planned. The action plan should also list ways that will spark interest in your lesson. Some ideas are: tell a story, ask a question, show pictures, dem- onstrate, refer to students’ personal lives, attitudes, or ideas, inspire by reading a quote. 87\n\nList your procedures in outline form focusing on the main points."

An example is while working on handstands, the focus is typically on balance, straight tight body, alignment, etc. Finally, provide potential or expected responses from students. You might write these expected student responses in parentheses after each item. Evaluation\n\nEvaluation divides into two aspects; evaluation of the students, and your own self-evaluation of how well the lesson seemed to go. Evaluation of students can be done by asking them questions near the end of the lesson. Summarize what was learned or done in the lesson. Ask\ta\tfew\tmain\tsummarizing\tquestions;\t“What\t did you learn about handstands?” “What drills helped you learn the most?” “How can we make the lesson more fun while still learning?”\n\nHave\tstudents\twork\tin\trelated\tfollow-up\twork (usually\tskill\trelated\tconditioning)\tuntil\tthe\tend\tof\t the class.

It might be giving clear direc- tions,\tasking\ta\tlogical\tsequence\tof\tskills\t(progressions),\t or asking questions that will involve the student’s cognitive domain. Your self-evaluation could focus on some aspect of class management, the effectiveness of involving students in the workout, moving the les- son along at an appropriate pace, the effectiveness of following each part of your lesson plan, or any part of teaching that is of most concern to you at this point in time.

However, you have just been pre- sented with a very important “teachable moment” that could benefit everyone involved – you, the two children involved as well as the children and parents observing the situation. Resist the impulse to get involved and resolve the situation for the children. Provide them with guidance only when necessary. Remember that our ultimate goal is to help the children learn how to take care of themselves – give them the opportunity to figure things out for themselves! Follow these five steps to resolve conflict:\n\nApproach:\n\nClose\tenough\tto\tintervene\tif\tnecessary •\t You’ve\tsignaled\tyour\tawareness\tand\tavailability\n\nAt this point we hope the children will be able to re- solve the situation to their mutual satisfaction. If there is no further conflict, if the children are able to resolve the issue themselves, no further action is necessary. If the children are not able to reach a mutually acceptable solution, it may be necessary to help them understand their feelings. Give them the tools to articulate what they are going through.

        "Do not confuse having fun with the absence of learning. It is a proven fact that people learn faster and better when they enjoy the process. Well-adjusted learners form an early and lifelong association that defines any attempt to learn something new:\n\nChallenge = Risk = Learning = FUN! A child that is mentally, physically, and emotionally prepared to succeed will accomplish a healthy learning attitude that will avoid the opposite association that includes Fear and Failure. Wrap up learning in fun to avoid unnecessary anxiety. A participant is least at risk when they are fully prepared to perform the skill being asked of them. A participant should be mentally ready to perform by fully understanding the skill and cog- nitively aware of what is expected. A participant must also be physically ready to perform by being strong enough, flexible enough, powerful enough, fast enough and generally physically able to perform the skill. The participant must also be emotionally ready to perform by being prepared on a psychological level – not overly confident, not overly fearful and focused on the task. A gymnast that is mentally and physically able to accomplish the skill and has the emotional foundation to per- form will be concentrating on the task and typically tries harder. This ultimately leads to a greater chance of successfully completing the skill and therefore less likely at risk of failure and injury.

Report any discrepancies to the Coordinator. If a student on your roster has not been in class for two days, you are required to call that student before the next class to check in and let that parent know that we care about their child missing three classes.

PRESCHOOL GYMNASTICS BALL ACTIvITIES\n\nWhether a person is two or one hundred and two, who can see a ball and not want to roll or bounce it? By simply rolling and bouncing a ball, children are learning about cause and effect, developing motor control, and building eye-hand coordination. Add a few different types of balls, and children use observation and predic- tion skills to investigate their properties. When you com- bine an enticing set of activities with an exciting object such as a ball, you have the ingredients for creative play that covers the gamut of curriculum areas. In the following activities, children will explore math\n\nand science topics as well as strengthen their physi- cal-development skills. More important, children will be having so much fun that they won’t even suspect all the wonderful learning that is happening! Getting Started\n\nBefore introducing the activities, give children time to\n\nexplore the balls and equipment. Then, try these ideas: Bring in a variety of balls and ball-shaped items. These could include small to large balls, even cotton balls, fabric ball “tassels,” and ball bearings. What makes something a ball? Encourage children to explore the different objects as you discuss what they notice about them. Ask children to hypothesize about how some of these balls are used. You might start a conver- sation about games that are played with balls. Children can brainstorm a list of “ball games” they know. Try this simple “roll the ball” game to get things started. Say one word that describes how you feel today\t(happy!)\tand\tthen\troll\ta\tball\tto\tsomeone\tin\tthe\t circle. That\tperson\tsays\thow\tshe\tis\tfeeling\t(tired)\tand\t rolls it to someone else. Not only will children have fun with the balls, they will be expressing themselves too! Best Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nUsing the Activities\n\nWith all this “ball talk,” children will be ripe and\n\nready to get busy and explore! Use the activities as they are written as a starting place. Then, think about ways to challenge children by adding new materials, new concepts, or questions. For example: Have a stopwatch or other type of timer to expand the ball activity: Children can make predictions about which type of ball will roll the fastest. Then change the size of the ball to see how that affects the timing. Introduce the concept of measurement by inviting children to use string to measure the circumference of the different balls. How can you use the balls and other equipment together? Just by asking a simple question, children can start thinking about all the different ways balls and other pieces of equipment work together for play and learning. Making Observations\n\nAs children participate in ball activities, watch for the\n\nfollowing:\n\nCan\tchildren\tbounce,\tcatch,\tthrow,\tand\troll\twith\t ease, grace, and strength? Can children think of new ways to use the balls? Do they need a few ideas to get them started, or do they work with the materials themselves to create the ideas? Is\tit\teasy\tor\tdifficult\tfor\tchildren\tto\tshift\tfrom\tusing\t balls for active play to using them for educational and scientific explorations? How\tdo\tchildren\tshare\tmaterials\tand\tnegotiate team playing? Conversations and Questions\n\nThe following questions are just the thing to get\n\nchildren thinking about these childhood favorites:\n\nAre\tall\tballs\tround? •\t Do\tall\tballs\tbounce? •\t Does\tthe\tsize\tof\tthe\tball\taffect\tthe\theight\tof\tthe bounce?

In Advance:\n\nGive children the opportunity to explore the card- board tubes. Ask: Where have you seen tubes like this? What were they used for? What things can you think of to do with the tube? If you put a ball in one end of a tube and lifted the tube, what do you think might happen? Activity:\n\nTo warm up, gather your group in a spread-out circle\n\non your mat or in your group play space. Take turns rolling a tennis ball to each child and have them roll it back to you or one of their classmates. Ask children if they have any ideas about why a ball rolls. Best Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nDivide your group into teams of two. Give each team\n\none tube and different kinds of balls. Invite each team of children to elevate one end of their tube on a chair or box to make an incline. Encourage one child to drop the ball at the top of the tube and the other child to catch it at the bottom. Ask children if they have any ideas about why the ball rolls down. Now, ask your teams to do some experimenting. Suggest that they place their tube at varied heights. Encourage them to roll their balls through the tubes and\tsee\thow\tfar\tthey\troll. (You\tmight\twant\tto\tmark\tthe\t spots\twhere\tthe\tballs\tstop\twith\tchalk\tor\tmasking\ttape.) Invite children to find out which type of ball rolls the\n\ngreatest distance from their tubes. Later, invite children to try to connect the tubes,\n\ncreating longer pathways for the balls. For younger children: Give children practice rolling larger rubber balls to one another before experi- menting with rolling smaller-size balls. For older children: Encourage children to build dif- ferent foundations for their tubes using cardboard or wood blocks. How many types of designs can they construct? Observations:\n\nWhich children seem to enjoy making comparisons and measuring the distance of how far their balls roll? Which children try their own creative ways of using the balls and tubes? Spin Off:\n\nCreate a maze constructed of mats, cones and\n\nblocks. Invite children to take turns kicking or bouncing different-size balls through the maze. PARACHUTE BALL Materials:\n\nParachute\tor\told\tsheet •\t Old\ttowels\tor\tfabric\n\nObjective:\n\nChildren will practice large motor, cooperation, and\n\nprediction skills as they play this game. In Advance:\n\nExplain to children that they will be bouncing balls on\n\nparachutes or towels. Ask them to predict how many times they will be able to bounce the ball as a group and in pairs. 93\n\nActivity:\n\nBring an old sheet or a parachute and several balls to the play area. Invite children to take the ends of the parachute so that it is opened wide and taut. Place a ball on top of the parachute. Help children move the parachute up and down so that the ball bounces on top. Encourage them to count how many bounces the ball takes. How long can they keep the parachute in motion before the ball falls off? Invite children to place several balls on top of the parachute. Can they move the parachute and bounce several balls at once? Divide children into pairs. Give each duo an old towel or piece of fabric. Ask each child to hold one end. Place a ball on top of each towel. Can children work togeth- er to keep the ball bouncing on the towel? Encourage children to try to bounce their ball from their towel to another pair’s towel. Count the bounces to see which ball stays in motion the longest. Ask the pairs of children to form a line with each holding their towels. Can they bounce the ball from one towel to another down the line? Can they keep several balls moving at once? As they play, record the actual number of times they\n\nhave been able to bounce the balls on the towels. Compare these numbers with their predictions when you return to class. Ask: “Did you do fewer or more bounces than you predicted?”\n\nEncourage children to develop new games with the balls and parachute. Older children may enjoy thinking of more complex ways to play. RELAYS Materials:\n\nBalls •\t Chalk •\t Cones\n\nObjective:\n\nChildren will develop motor skills and engage in ac- tivities that encourage teamwork and creative thinking. In Advance:\n\nTalk with children about different kinds of ball games\n\nthey are familiar with. Ask: What is your favorite ball game? What kind of ball do you need to play it? Encourage children to discuss how the games change when teams are involved. Ask: What do you like best about being a part of a team? How is it easier to play a game when you’re part of a team? How does it make the game harder? Best Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nActivity:\n\nBefore beginning, explain to children that they will be playing several relay games. Ask them to remain as a group when they reach the start so they can easily organize themselves for the game."

        "Ask children to form a straight line. Draw a thick\n\nline with chalk to specify where they should stand. Explain that you would like them to think of different ways to move the ball from the front of the line to the back. Write down children’s ideas and use them to develop each race. As the ball reaches the back of the line, the last person will move to the front. Place a plastic cone a few\n\nfeet from the front of the line. Invite children to create a few relay-race games using the ball to reach the cone be- fore passing it to the next child in line. Record children’s ideas, and then begin. Space several plastic cones a few feet apart. Ask children to take turns moving the ball with their feet through the cones before passing it to the next person. Invite them to brainstorm other ways to move through the cones. During group time, ask children to discuss the relay races they played. Which ones did they like best? Ask them to think of other types of objects they might be able to use in the race. For younger children: Simplify the activity by hav- ing children run to you with the ball and then back to their group of friends. For older children: See if children can invent their own relay-race games and use their suggestions during outdoor play time. REMEMBER Children over four may get competitive when play- ing games that involve motor skills. Remind them that there are no winners or losers-just players. Spin Off:\n\nUse a digital sports stopwatch to time the children’s relay races, and invite children to take turns timing dif- ferent races. Keep a list of the different times to record on a graph later. Engage children in a discussion com-\n\n94\n\nparing the different times of each race. Which races were longer? Why were some races quicker? PRESCHOOL PARACHUTE ACTIvITIES\n\nAll children revel in play – games such as Tag and Hide & Seek go back generations. We all thrive with physical exercise and that same exercise clears the mind as well. Children need to physically expend energy peri- odically during their learning process. Games are vehicles where children develop physically, mentally, and socially, learn- ing to relate to each other as well as how to compete and/or work together. In the games are lessons in individ- ual strengths and weaknesses,\n\ncoping with success or failure. Many games act as abstractions of reality, where the principles of life are\n\nacted out in “play” situations. Games are also an excellent way to build cohesion\n\nin a group of people as they learn to trust and work together. They break the ice and help people new to a group become better acquainted, and accepted. Teen groups also enjoy new games. Adults, once they relax, find them quite refreshing and invigorating as well. A parachute is a wonderful addition to the play equipment in any Gymnastics program. Beautiful and sometimes calming, a parachute can create soft, whis- pering sounds or loud, rippling noises, depending on how quickly it is moved. Parachutes are usually made of brightly colored, lightweight nylon and are equipped with strong, reinforced handholds. Why incorporate parachute play into your program? Because parachute games encourage cooperative, non-competitive play and reinforce turn taking and sharing. While most gross motor activities for young children develop muscles in the lower body more than the upper torso, parachutes strengthen primarily shoulder, arm and hand muscles. When children work together to make the parachute billow, they also refine perceptual motor skills and develop a sense of rhythm. Language activities are also often incorporated into most parachute games. Parachutes are a lot of fun for both children and adults to play with, especially in open floor exercise areas, gymnasiums, or large, grassy areas. The opportu- nities to encourage children’s overall development with\n\nBest Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nthis exciting activity make it an ideal choice for early childhood programming. Parachutes can be purchased from athletic supply warehouses, early childhood sup- pliers,\tand\tarmy\tsurplus\tstores\t(although\tthe\tlatter\twill\t be\tless\tcolorful). HERE ARE SOME COLLECTED SUGGES- TIONS FOR PARACHUTE GAMES:\n\nIntro Game\n\nThis game is great for very young children as an in- troduction to the parachute that does not require much cooperation. Have each participant grab a handle with both hands. Have the children “shake” the parachute up and down, then side-to-side. Ask them to put the handle on their nose…chin…ear…knees…toes, etc. You can then have them join you in singing “Head, Shoulders, Knees, & Toes” while they put the para- chute handle on those body parts. Stretching Game\n\nThis game is also good for very young children as group time activity that does not require much cooper- ation. Have each participant sit on a colored section of the parachute. Have the children demonstrate various body positions; tuck, pike, straddle, arch, cat stretch, table, v-sit, etc. You can then ask them to sit outside the parachute with their legs underneath and repeat many of the same instructions. Mushroom\n\nThis is not so much a game, more an essential start- ing point for parachute play. Get everyone to spread out the parachute and hold the edge, spaced out more or less evenly so they’re standing in a circle. Pull the chute\ttaut\tand\tlower\tit\tto\tthe\tground\t(or\tknee\tlevel). On\tthe\tmagic\tword\t(e.g. Mushroom!)\teveryone\tpulls\t the\tchute\tupwards\t(don’t\tlet\tgo). It\twill\tfill\twith\tair\tand\t rise up like a giant mushroom - or igloo. To get it as high as possible everyone must take a couple of paces towards the center as the chute rises. It’s good to prac- tice this so that the group can learn to work effectively as a team and get the chute really high. It won’t work without co-operation. Variations:\n\nOnce you’ve mastered the basic mushroom it’s fun to experiment. See what happens if: Everyone mushrooms and then runs to the center, still holding the chute. Everyone mushrooms, and then lets go, especially out- doors on a windy day! Everyone lets go at exactly the same time. If there isn’t any wind, the chute will retain its perfect mushroom shape and rise straight up in the\n\n95\n\nair. Indoors it may go up to the ceiling. To get this right it’s best for someone to shout “One...Two...Three... Go!” or similar, immediately after the “Mushroom!” instruction. For everyone to let go at exactly the right instant will take practice and concentration. Groups of children who haven’t played with a parachute before will probably be delighted and fascinated by the effect for quite a while before you move on to any other games. It’s particularly spectacular when the sun is shining down through the chute. Roller Ball\n\nEveryone holds the chute taut. Place a large ball near\n\nthe edge. Try to make the ball roll around the edge of the chute. To do this someone starts the ball rolling. As it comes towards you, you lower the edge you are holding, and as it goes past you raise your edge. When all the players do this in synchronization it creates a wave going round the edge, pushing the ball round in front of it in a smooth, steady circle. It cannot be done without concentration and co-operation! However, it is very rewarding for the group to eventually achieve a smooth, continuous motion. Once you’ve done this try speeding up – or change direction. Big Turtle\n\nHave the children get on their hands and knees under a large “turtle shell” and try to make the turtle more in one direction. As a cooperative game, children have to work together to get the turtle to move. Variation:\n\nHave the turtle go over a hill or bench or through an\n\nobstacle course without losing the shell. The Ocean\n\nPretend the parachute is the ocean. Have the children\n\ngive the name of an ocean. Children move the para- chute in response to the ‘weather report’ they heard. (This\tencourages\tchildren\tto\tbe\tcreative). For\texample,\t say, “I heard on the weather report this morning that there was a slight breeze over the Atlantic. What would that look like?” The children respond by making small waves in the parachute. Other suggestions have been –\thigh\twinds,\tsnow\t(we\twould\thave\tto\tpull\tit\ttight\tto\t make\tthe\tice),\ttwisters,\tetc. Once\tthey\tget\tthe\thang\tof\t it the possibilities are endless. Jaws\n\nEveryone sits on the floor in a circle holding the para- chute stretched out with his or her legs underneath it. The chute is the sea and they are sitting on the beach, happily dipping their toes in the water. By shaking the edge of the chute realistic ripple or wave effects can\n\nBest Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nbe generated. Once the waves are going well some- one is selected to be a shark and disappears under the chute. They move around underneath and because of the waves it will be difficult to see where they are. The shark chooses a victim and grabs him or her by the feet. The victim can give an appropriate scream before disappearing under the chute. This person now be- comes a new shark. To prolong the game you can have the original shark revert to being a bather - or to make it more lively you can have several sharks in there at once. To finish the game you can choose ‘once a shark, always a shark’ - so everyone eventually becomes a shark. You can introduce freak weather conditions - or even a killer whale! See-saw Pull\n\nFrom a sitting position, have the children pull the\n\nchute back and forth in a see-sawing motion. Make Waves\n\nWhile gripping the parachute, everyone moves their\n\narms up and down to make small and large waves. Ball Roll\n\nHave the children try to roll balls into the hole in the\n\ncenter of the parachute. Chute Lift\n\nAsk the children to lift the parachute high over their heads and down again. Talk about the soft sounds and breezes that are created. Move the parachute faster and notice the different effects. Another Mushroom\n\nFrom a standing position, lift the parachute from the\n\nground\tto\twaist\theight,\tcounting\tone\t(lift)\tand\ttwo\t (lift). On\tthree\t(lift),\thave\teveryone\traise\tthe\tparachute\t high over their heads and then crouch down, pulling the parachute tightly behind them. A mushroom effect is created as the parachute settles. Parachute Tag\n\nLift the parachute high overhead. Call one child’s name\n\nand\thave\ther\trun\t(skip,\thop,\ttwirl\tor\tcrawl)\tto\tthe\tother\t side before the parachute comes down and tags her. One-Hand Run\n\nHave each child hold the parachute with one hand,\n\nextending the opposite arm out for balance. Run around in one direction, then change and run around in the other direction."

        "A variation would be to use mu- sic\tas\tthe\tcue\tfor\tchanging\tdirection\t(i.e. direction\tcan\t be\tchanged\tevery\ttime\tthe\tmusic\tstops). 96\n\nParachute Run\n\nHave the children take turns running on the para- chute as it lies on the ground, while the other children make waves. See how long the children can maneuver on the waves before falling down. The length of turns can be determined by the length of the songs that the children\tchoose\tto\tsing\t(i.e. everyone’s\tturn\tlasts\tthe\t length\tof\tone\tsong). Popcorn\n\nPlace a number of beanbags, balloons, or cotton balls on the chute. Shake the chute to make them rise like popcorn. Poison Snake\n\nPlace\tfour\tto\tsix\tpieces\tof\tyarn\tor\tstring\t(jump\tropes\n\nwork\twell!)\ton\tthe\tchute. By\tshaking\tthe\tchute,\ttry\t to make them hit the players on the other side. Keep track\tof\twho\tgets\tbitten. (With\tyounger\tchildren\tyou\t might\twant\tto\tdo\tsnake\tor\tworm\tkisses\tinstead.)\n\nPompoms\n\nPut the pompoms in the middle. Sprinkle various sized pompoms in the top of the shoot and try to get them into the middle pocket. You could have teams with different colors and count how many they get in. Shaking the Rug and Making Waves\n\nShaking rug involves rapid movement either light or heavy. Making waves are large movements to send billow of cloth up and down like waves. Waves can be small, medium or large. Kids can alternate turns to see who can make the best waves. Merry-Go-Round\n\nTurn the bodies so that the chute is held with only one hand, walk, hop, jump, skip around holding the chute. It looks like a merry-go-round. Cathedral\n\nEveryone lowers the chute and then on the count of three raise his or her arms high once the chute is quite high. Everyone takes 3-4 giant steps toward the center and pulls the chute behind them and sit down with their bottoms on the edge of the chute. Cat and Mouse\n\n(Although\tsome\tmight\tfind\tthis\tdangerous\t-\tjust\tmake\n\nsure the cat is crawling on all fours and not running upright. I have personally done this and if you take the proper\tprecautions\tit\tcan\tbe\tfun\tand\tuneventful.)\tOne\t child\t(the\tmouse)\tis\tunder\tthe\tchute,\teveryone\tis\tshaking\t it,\tquite\tclose\tto\tthe\tground\tand\tanother\tchild\t(shoes\t off)\tcrawls\ton\ttop\tand\ttries\tto\thunt\tand\ttag\tthe\tmouse. Best Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nRunning by Numbers\n\nIf the chute is a large one...the kids love to run un- derneath and switch places with others - could number them 1 through 5 around the circle- and then call out a number. There Was a Man\n\nChildren walk around in a circle hanging onto the\n\nparachute."

        "There was a man in our town, Who went for a WALK one day, But the wind blew so hard, He turned around, And WALKED the other way. Different actions, such as run, hop, skip, etc. may replace walk. Weather\n\nWe start calm sitting on the floor and it’s a gentle breeze then rain and move up to a thunder storm with everyone standing up holding handles shaking as hard as they can to make thunder. Drop the Ball\n\nPlace a soft ball of any size in the center and you have\n\nto try to keep the ball from falling off on your side. Circus Tent\n\nPull the parachute up into the air. Step under it. Pull it down behind you and sit down with the parachute tucked under your bottom. We call this our circus tent. When the Parachute Goes Up\n\nSung to: “If you’re happy and you know it”\n\nWhen the parachute goes up…Stomp your feet When the parachute goes up…Stomp your feet When the parachute is high, and floats up in the sky When the parachute goes up…Stomp your feet. ...bend your knees ...wiggle your bottom ...lift one leg ...shout hooray ...shake your head, etc. etc. Name Game\n\nSung to: “Row, Row, Row your Boat”\n\nUp, up, up it goes Down, down, down it comes If your name is------- (put in a child’s name) Now’s your turn to run\n\nAs you sing the song have the children raise the parachute above their heads. When a child is named\n\n97\n\nhave him/her run under the parachute. Then slowly lower the parachute to try and trap the child. Continue until all children have had a turn. Hop Scotch\n\nPlace\tthe\tparachute\t(preferably\ta\tsmall\tone)\tspread\t out on the floor. Take beanbags or something similar and have the children toss them onto specific colors; then hop on the colors without beanbags on them. Leaf Toss\n\nTake a sheet, or a parachute. Gather real leaves, fabric leaves, or paper leaves. Place them in the middle of the sheet. Gather around the sheet and have the children lift the sheet slowly and then quickly to see how all the leaves “float.”\n\nFun under the Chute\n\nGrasp the edge of the parachute with an overhand grip and inflate. Beanbags, skipping ropes, balls, etc. have been placed under the parachute. Participants are numbered. Leader calls out a number and those partici- pants run under the parachute and perform before the parachute deflates. Toad in the Hole\n\nGrasp the edge of the parachute with an overhand grip. Place two different colored, small, rubber balls on the\tparachute. Divide\tthe\tgroup\tinto\ttwo\tteams\t(each\t team has one of the colored balls. One team is on one side of the chute and the other team on the opposite side.). Each\tteam\ttries\tto\tshake\tits\tball\tinto\tthe\tcenter\t hole before the other team. A point is scored each time a team’s ball goes through the hole. Birthday Exchange\n\nGrasp the edge of the parachute with an overhand grip, and inflate. Leader calls out a month of the year. Those students born in that month let go of the edge and exchange places by moving under the parachute to an empty spot. This game can also take place by giving everyone a number from 1 to 8 or by calling out a color that the kids are wearing. Bird and Worm\n\nIn a kneeling position, grasp the edge of the para-\n\nchute with an overhand grip. One or two children are chosen to be worms. They go under the chute on hands and knees. Another child is chosen to be the bird. The bird crawls on top of the parachute on hands and knees and tries to catch the moving worms. To make it more difficult for the bird, the Beavers around the outside edge are waving the parachute up and down. Therefore the bird has difficulty seeing the\n\nBest Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nworms, but the worms can see the bird’s shadow from underneath. When the bird does catch the worms, a new bird and new worms are chosen. Spinner\n\nHave kids assemble around the para- chute. Pick 1-5 kids to sit or lay down in the middle of the chute. Have the remaining kids grab the sides of the parachute tightly and walk slowly in a circle around the middle. Watch as the kids in the middle become encased within the parachute and then pull outward to release the encased children. Alligator Saver\n\nHave the children sit around\n\nthe parachute with their legs underneath. Their legs should be straight and the parachute should be held at the waist. Choose one or two children to be alligators and two or three to be medics. The alligators hide under the parachute and eat people by tugging on their victim’s feet and pulling them under. The victim then becomes and alligator. The medics run around the outside of the circle and hold people when they begin to be pulled under and are yelling for help. Start a new game after there are so many alligators that the integrity of the parachute circle collapses. Caution the children not to play tug-of-war with victims. If a person is being saved, then the alligator has to find a new victim, not con- tinue to pull. Also, victims should allow themselves to be pulled under."

        "This will help to avoid rug burns and other injuries. Parachute volleyball\n\nThis game requires two large parachutes and at least one ball. Split the children up into two teams. Put one team around each parachute. Each team should be standing, holding the parachute with both hands. Place the ball on one of the parachutes. The object is for the team with the ball to propel the ball into the air and have it land on the other team’s parachute. This process then repeats itself going back the other direction."

        "Once they have accomplished this move the teams increas- ingly further apart. Air Conditioner\n\nThis game is good for recuperation after an energetic\n\ngame. Hold the chute stretched out and have about a third\tof\tthe\tpeople\tlie\ton\tthe\tground\tunder\tit\t(best\twith\n\n98\n\nheads\tnear\tthe\tmiddle). The\trest\tmushroom\tthe\tchute\t up and quickly pull it down again repeatedly. Air rush- ing in and out cools those underneath like a giant fan, and the sensation of watching the chute rise up and then come down on top of you is very strange. Hammock\n\nGet everyone to roll the chute up from the edge towards the center. Stop when you’ve got a circle\n\nabout six feet in diameter left. Let a volunteer lie on this and be swung backwards and for- wards or side to side. Rolling the chute up like this is also a good way of getting every- one to help when it’s time to put away. Rocker A co-operative type of trust game best saved for Parent-Tot class-\n\nes. Several students lie on the chute,\n\nfeet to the center. Others lift up the edges,\n\nso\ttheir\tbodies\trise\tup\t(but\tfeet\tremain\tdown). They\t can then be swayed gently."

        "Take turns in the middle. Teacher Call-Out\n\nNumber the children by threes or fours around the\n\nchute, so that you have an equal number of ones, twos, threes and fours evenly spread out. Mushroom the chute, then call out a number and also a descrip- tion of who you would like them to act as. For ex- ample, if you call out: “Mushroom...Number ones are ballerinas”, all of the number ones have to cross under the chute, acting like ballerinas on the way. Catcher\n\nFour people hang onto the parachute. The four\n\nwith the parachute run after the other children. If they succeed in covering the child with the parachute, the child is now caught and must attach him or her self to the parachute. Now they join in, to catch the other children. PRESCHOOL GYMNASTICS HOOP ACTIvITIES\n\nWhether a person is two or one hundred and two, who can see a hoop and not want to twirl, spin or play with it? By simply rolling or spinning a hoop, children are learning about cause and effect, developing motor control, and building eye-hand coordination. Add a\n\nBest Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nfew different sizes or types of hoops, and children use observation and prediction skills to investigate their properties. When you combine an enticing set of activi- ties with an exciting object such as a hoop, you have the ingredients for creative play that covers the gamut of curriculum areas. In the following activities, children will explore math\n\nand science topics as well as strengthen their physi- cal-development skills. More important, children will be having so much fun that they won’t even suspect all the wonderful learning that is happening! Getting Started\n\nBefore introducing the activities, give children time to explore the hoops and equipment. Then, try these ideas:\n\nBring in a variety of colors, sizes and hoop-shaped items. These could include small to large hoops, rings, ovals, circles, and loops. What makes something a hoop? Encourage children to explore the different objects as you discuss what they notice about them. Ask children to hypothesize about how some of these hoops are used. You might start a conversation about games that are played with hoops. Children can brain- storm a list of “hoop games” they know. Try this simple “hold the hoop” game to get things\n\nstarted. Say one word that describes how you feel today\t(happy!)\tand\tthen\tperform\ta\tskill\t(stand\ton\tone\t foot,\tstand\tin\ta\tstraddle,\tsquat,\tetc,)\tin\tthe\tcircle. That\t person\tsays\thow\tshe\tis\tfeeling\t(tired)\tand\tcalls\tout\ta\tpo- sition. Not only will children have fun with the hoops, they will be expressing themselves too! Using the Activities\n\nWith all this “hoop talk,” children will be ripe and ready to get busy and explore! Use the activities as they are written as a starting place. Then, think about ways to challenge children by adding new materials, new concepts, or questions. For example: Have a stopwatch or other type of timer to expand the hoop activity: Chil- dren can make predictions about which type of hoop will roll the farthest. Then change the size of the hoop to see how that affects the timing. Introduce the con- cept of measurement by inviting children to use string to measure the circumference of the different hoops. How can you use the hoops and other equipment together? Just by asking a simple question, children can start thinking about all the different ways hoops and other pieces of equipment work together for play and learning. Making Observations\n\nAs children participate in hoop activities, watch for\n\n99\n\nthe following:\n\nCan children hold, catch, throw, spin and roll with ease, grace, and strength? Can children think of new ways to use the hoops? Do they need a few ideas to get them started, or do they work with the materials themselves to create the ideas? Is it easy or difficult for children to shift from using hoops for active play to using them for educational and scientific explorations? How do children share materials and negotiate team\n\nplaying? Conversations and Questions\n\nThe following questions are just the thing to get\n\nchildren thinking about these childhood favorites:\n\nAre\tall\thoops\tround? •\t Do\tall\thoops\troll? •\t Does\tthe\tsize\tof\tthe\thoop\taffect\tthe\tspeed\tof\tthe roll / spin?

Aim for games where everyone is involved."

        "Standing around idle is opportunity for shoving, etc. And nobody likes to be “eliminated” from play for a long period of time and have to just stand around watching. Be very open and welcoming to everyone, even a bit silly, modeling the style of play you want to encourage, Assure them with words and gestures that each game will be fun. Dress up the games with names promising fun, add appropriate “pretend” elements, and develop the group’s ability to play together. Whatever the situation begin with simple games, easily explained, with simple equipment that provide easy access and that have few rules, that will end quickly so transition can be made to new games. Make room for new arrivals or latecomers and quickly incor- porate them into play. Be ready to shift games as group size changes. Game playing is initially best started by having the group forming a circle while the leader explains the game. You can play games in this formation, count off to create teams, or walk around the circle, while every- one has their eyes closed, touching backs to designate secret players or create “It.”\n\nMake sure everybody can hear you. Begin with a general description of the game including its imagery, object and if possible a familiar game category. Try to give them choices as to who plays what. Practice any special moves or phrases ahead of time. Have a balance of strenuous and lower activity games. Let players stretch their bodies and feelings slowly at first. Try to conclude with an appropriate “wind-down” game as well. Be sensitive to when the players are getting tired and may need a less strenu- ous game, or even to stop playing; or when they are becoming bored and need something new or more “interesting.”\n\nBe very safety conscious, and give clear safety instructions to the children. Make it clear that the objective is a good time for everyone. Stress the use of strategy and teamwork. Avoid contact games - some will get rough, tempers get shorter as time goes by, and someone always gets hurt. Work towards building trusting relationships be-\n\ntween players. Balance individual expression with group awareness and community sharing. Play down aggres- sive competition, stress co-operation. As the leader, don’t take yourself too seriously. Keep your sense of humor at all times, just one outburst of anger will turn\n\n100\n\neverybody off. Encourage and keep alive the make-be- lieve imagery of the games. Play with them as much as practical and possible. Ideal situations are those where the children take over the leadership of the play. Try to keep teams evenly matched - some kids will\n\nalways try to stay together; some will need “nudg- ing” to get them involved, hopefully most will show some enthusiasm once you get started. Expect some resistance; be enthusiastic! Boys and girls will tend to separate from each other. Counting off usually pro- duces fair mixes. Have a signal for “everyone to be quiet and pay at- tention” such as everyone raising the “one” sign. Don’t tolerate rowdiness or discipline problems - persistent troublemakers should be told to return to their parent. Be prepared to modify the game to maintain or cre- ate a balance in the level of challenge. Keep the game from being too goal-oriented. Give everyone equal op- portunity to play different roles, and don’t allow certain people to dominate. Increasing or decreasing chal- lenge, simplifying or complicating moves, and changing boundaries may be necessary to adjust the speed of the game, its dimensions and the ease of achieving its object. You want everyone to have as equal an oppor- tunity to enjoy participation in the game. Be flexible – if a game isn’t working, adapt the game or do something else. If a game is working well, stick with it. A variety of several games they know well and enjoy is better than trying new games every single day. Older kids especially seem to prefer the same game every day. Relay races always work well, especially if made slightly com- plicated, and are good to fall back on when other games aren’t working. With larger groups, break into multiple teams."

        "Watch your time! Hula-Hoop Center\n\nTurn any floor area in your room into an instant learning center. Put a hoop on the floor and place a folder activity and game pieces within the circle. The hoop provides a well-defined work space which can be moved easily at your convenience. Obstacle Course Materials\n\n10 Small hoops\n\nObjective\n\nEncourage physical development by setting up an age-appropriate challenge course where children use large-motor skills. Best Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nIn Advance\n\nUsing hoops, set up an outdoor obstacle course. Place the small hoops in a line that’s easy for children to step in approximately one foot from the end of the previous hoop. Use chalk or colored tape to mark the spot where you want children to begin. Take a minute to do the obstacle course yourself, making sure it will work for your group. Activity\n\nHave everything set up before you take your group\n\noutside. Explain to children that the activity they are going to be doing is called an obstacle course. Some may be familiar with the term and want to share what they already know. Explain to children that each person begins at the colored mark on the ground and that everyone will have a turn hop on both feet through the hoops, hop on one foot through the hoops, and crawl through the hoops\t(bear\twalk). When\tthey\tfinish,\tthey\tcan\treturn\tto\t the end of the line and wait for another turn. Accompany\tthe\tactivity\twith\ta\tsong\t(sung\tto\tthe\ttune\n\nof\t“She’ll\tBe\tComing\t‘Round\tthe\tMountain”):\tThey’ll\t be hopping on two feet when they come. They’ll be hopping on two feet when they come. They’ll be hop- ping on two feet, they’ll be hopping on two feet, and they’ll be hopping on two feet when they come. Change verses to “hopping on one foot,” “hopping\n\nthrough the hoops,” “crawling through the hoops.”\n\nFor younger children: Begin with a simplified version\n\nof the obstacle course. As children become familiar with the course, you can add to it gradually. For older children: Use chalk to add numbers and\n\nletters to the area inside the hoops. Invite children to “hop to number 3,” “skip to letter A,” “jump to number 8.”\n\nKeep group sizes small. Two- and three-year olds will get frustrated if asked to wait a long time for their turn. When children have mastered this course, ask for their help constructing a new one. Musical Islands\n\nA great non-competitive “musical chairs” type of\n\ngame. Materials\n\n6-8\thula\thoops •\t Cassette\ttape\tor\tCD\tof\tlively\tmusic •\t Cassette\tor\tCD\tplayer\n\nObjective:\n\nChildren will practice problem-solving skills in an ef-\n\nfort to work cooperatively. 101\n\nIn Advance\n\nPlace hoops on the floor or on the ground in a large\n\nopen space. Activity\n\nGather children together. Ask them to demonstrate ways they can move and stretch to make their bodies bigger and smaller. Put on the music and point out the hula hoops to children. Ask them to pretend the hoops are islands and that they are on a trip. Invite children to begin their travels by walking, hopping, tip-toeing, or skipping around the island hula hoops as the music plays. Explain that when the music stops, they must stop their traveling and “visit” one of the islands by placing a foot inside any of the hoops. Make sure everyone knows that more than one child can visit the same island at the same time. Turn on the music again and send travelers back on their way, skipping, hopping, or jumping, but this time remove one of the hoops. Encourage children to continue traveling in different ways and routes around the island as the music plays. Every time the music stops, have one less hoop avail- able. Challenge children to squeeze closer together and use their ingenuity to find ways for every traveler to fit a foot or toe in the fewer and fewer spaces, even when there is only one remaining island! For younger children - Try using 10 hoops when introducing children to the activity to give them more space and time to become acquainted with the activity. For older children: After you’ve enjoyed the activ- ity, encourage children to create pictures and dictate stories about island life. REMEMBER Help children work together to find a way to fit everyone on the last island. Children will love it if you play too. Other option\n\nSet up a circle of hoops, making sure you have half the number of hoops as you have children in the group. Invite children to find a hoop to sit in with a partner. Next, call out an instruction, such as “If you are wearing tie shoes, move over one hoop,” or “if you had juice with breakfast, move to the hoop across the circle from where you’re sitting.” Let children know that their main goal is to help as many people share the appropriate space as possible. Best Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nHop In the Hoops\n\nMaterials\n\nDifferent colored hoops, an open area and drum or\n\ntambourine. Activity\n\nLet the children warm up in an open area. Give the children different ideas for moving around - walk, hop, skip, run, walk sideways, and run backwards, and so on. Place lots of different colored hoops around the open space. Demonstrate to the children how to walk or run around without touching the hoops. Intersperse these instructions with ‘stand in groups of two in red hoops’ or ’three people go into each green hoop’ and so on. Get the children to listen to the next instruction using\n\na tambour, beat the drum or clap your hands; the chil- dren stop and listen for the next step. For example, put your hand in a hoop; put your foot in a hoop."

        "Make it more complex by adding colors and numbers. For example, put one knee in a red hoop, put four fingers in a yellow hoop and so on. REMEMBER Children over four may get competitive when play- ing games that involve motor skills. Remind them that there are no winners or losers-just players. Spin Off:\n\nUse a digital sports stopwatch to time the children’s relay races, and invite children to take turns timing dif- ferent races. Keep a list of the different times to record on a graph later. Engage children in a discussion com- paring the different times of each race. Which races were longer? Why were some races quicker?

STEP #2\n\nTo set up your tap, you will need to hollow your entire body. To do this, you need to use your upper body and not just your hips. Try to round your back and avoid just piking at the hips. STEP #3\n\nAs you approach the bottom of the swing, it’s time to relax a little and let gravity create a natural tap. Your body will go from the hollow position to an arched po- sition. Be sure to keep perfect form, however. Imagine leading through the bottom with your belly button. STEP #4\n\nAs you pass through the bottom, your legs will\n\nautomatically\tbegin\tto\tlift\tforward\t(if\tyou\tare\trelaxed). As you kick through the bottom, lift your knees vigor- ously as though you were doing a flyaway dismount. Lift your knees in front of you, bending at the hips and knees. Be sure that you are lifting your knees rather than just dragging your feet behind. STEP #5\n\nContinue lifting your knees while keeping your head between your arms. Do not throw your head back, as this might cause you to open up from your tuck posi- tion. Keep your shoulder angle firm. As you lift your knees, you will be shortening the radius of your giant circle. In terms of physics, this is what enables you to go over the top. Most beginners open up at this point and look back at the bar. If you do that, you will slow your swing by enlarging the radius of your giant circle. STEP #6\n\nKeep your knees bent all the way to the top. When\n\nyou make it to the handstand, just straighten your knees and start the giant again. You may go a little faster than you expected, because when you shorten the radius of the circle you will speed up. Don’t worry; you will learn how to control it very easily. When you have mastered the bent-knee giant, go ahead and try going all the way around with straight legs\t(lifting\tthe\ttoes\tinstead\tof\tthe\tknees). At\tfirst,\tit’s\t a good idea to do the first 1-2 giant with bent knees\n\n106\n\nto get some momentum, and then straighten your legs for the rest of the set. EASY DRILLS FOR TWISTING SkILLS “Easy Drills for Twisting Skills” is a FUNdamental progression system that coaches can use to teach twist- ing skills in their recreational classes. Almost all of the drills are appropriate for and could be performed by 6-year-old beginning gymnasts up through adults. This is a comprehensive list of drills to be performed at vari- ous stations: floor exercise, mat stations, and trampo- line. This system has proven very effective but is by no means the “end-all” list of possible progressions.

Positive coaching a competitive gymnast\n\nYou may have found yourself in a position of trying\n\nto get a gymnast to perform a particular skill or drill and have that gymnast unable to complete the as- signment or maybe simply refuse to try. How did you respond? Many coaches end up treating that gymnast as they were treated by their coaches back when they were athletes – often with threats and punishment. Back in the “old days” coaches were typically dictato- rial disciplinarians in control of all aspects of practices and competitions with no room for anything but com- plete compliance with their directions. The time for such negative coaching is past. It may\n\nBest Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\ntake more effort and planning to be a positive coach but it does not necessarily take more time to produce upper level gymnasts. Successful coaches will lay out the plan for athletic excellence and articulate the plan to the gymnasts. Coaches must accept that an athlete will ultimately set the pace and that there are no short- cuts and resist trying to accelerate the learning curve. Regardless of the age of the competitive gymnast, coaches must engage the athlete to take responsibility for their own improvement and achievement. Too of- ten, coaches live vicariously through the success of their gymnast and don’t allow the athlete to make choices and accept the responsibility for their actions. Coaches need to learn to check their ego at the door. There must be natural consequences for misbehav- ior but coaches need to create an environment that allows mistakes. If an athlete deliberately violates an established training rule, there should be a logical consequence; for example, arriving late for practice may result in staying late to make up the missed work; failure to attempt or complete assignments may result in being withdrawn from the next meet. Mistakes, however, should be an accepted part of work-outs. Mistakes need to be addressed and corrected but there should not be “punishment” included in the response to an error. Gymnasts must be allowed to learn from mistakes\tand\thelped\t(coached)\tto\trecognize\tand\tunder- stand the mistake and the method to correct it. Gymnastics is certainly a difficult enough sport; most gymnasts do not intentionally make mistakes while per- forming. A gymnast that believes they will be punished or criticized no matter how hard they try will simply stop trying whereas an athlete that is relaxed and not performing under fear of retaliation by the coach for making a mistake will perform at an optimal level. Coaches that use a young gymnast’s age as an\n\nexcuse to dominate and dictate are simply not develop- ing the type of athlete that is self-reliant and self-mo- tivated. Provided with positive choices and direction,\n\n108\n\neven the youngest competitive gymnast can learn to take charge of themselves and coaches will end up with motivated, goal oriented athletes. Like trying to put toothpaste back in a tube, you cannot take back negative comments once they are exclaimed. There are still too many coaches that discipline their athletes with “extra” conditioning. What can be gained by assigning “extra” conditioning as a punishment for mistakes? Using exercise as a punishment is counter- productive in that we should be trying to teach our athletes to appreciate conditioning rather than equate exercise to a negative. What can be accomplished by assigning meaningless repetitions in the name of dis- cipline? Skills repeated for the sake of repetition often lead to repetitive use injuries and little if any improve- ment is made in the skill. If an athlete balks or refuses to attempt an assigned skill, what benefit is there to send the child home as punishment for failing to try? A positive coach realizes that there is a reason for the problem and will try to find an explanation in order to find the solution. If the gymnast is afraid, help the child recognize, address and overcome the fear. When athletes come into your gym, how do they feel and what will they hear from you? Just as every athlete has physical differences in size, flexibility, strength and power, they also have psychological differences in personality and behavior. The challenge of positive coaching is recognizing the individual differences in each athlete and learning what motivates each to suc- ceed. Coaches must look at their duty as developing strong character rather than creating athletic machines that perform to their bidding. The strong individual is in control of their emotions and able to make wise decisions for themselves while willing to take responsi- bility for their actions. An athlete that is confident and self-motivated is much more apt to work harder and longer at an assignment."

        "Take the challenge; be a posi- tive coach. Best Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nCHAPTER EIGHT\n\nfacilities and equiPment\n\nFacilities – three key decisions\n\nWhen it comes to the most important factor to con- sider for where your facility should be, if you guessed “location, location, location” as the three key decisions noted in the sub-heading of this section you would not be far off the mark. Location is indeed the first of the three decisions that you must make when it comes to the actual physical reality of your gymnastics business. But the other two are just as important. So important, In fact, that it is highly likely that the decisions you make about your facilities will have more to do with the ultimate success of your gym than any other decisions you will make. If you make the right decisions you will have a much better chance to do a great job for your students and make a decent living than if you do not. The Three Decisions:\n\n1. Where should I locate the gym? 2. How big should the gym be? 3. How should I layout the gym? Where should I locate the gym? The old saying is right: location, location, location. If you ever want to make any money you must locate where there are enough children to fill your gym and you must locate in a community where the families make enough money to pay for gymnastics. High pop- ulation density and above average household income levels: these are the keys. strive to keep your costs low while you try to maximize your income. There are Tiny Town gyms all over America where\n\nthe owners open a gym in their town because they want to live and work in small town USA. They also want the benefits and joys of gymnastics to be avail- able to the children in small town USA and they want to be able to pursue their love of gymnastics. These owners are opening a gym in order to buy a certain lifestyle that is not so much centered on money as it is on staying close to home. Even so, the gym must still make a profit in order to keep the doors open. It should also be obvious that if you choose to open a gym in the inner city core of large-city, urban America you will have a very small business because many of the families who live in inner-city America cannot afford to pay for their children to take gymnastics in a for-profit gymnastics school. This is not to say that these children are not deserving nor does it imply that the parents of these children do not want their kids to have every opportunity. It is simply recognition of economic reality and it points to the need to have not- for-profit recreation centers, church and civic organiza- tions, YMCA’s and other entities shoulder much of the work here. However, there are gyms that do make a go of it in these environments and some of these gyms have been in business for years. Like their counterparts in small town rural America these gym owners do not operate their gyms so much for the financial rewards as they do for the kid and community rewards. God bless them all. There are some exceptions\n\nIt should be obvious that if you live in a tiny town in rural Ohio and you want to open a gymnastics business in your tiny town you will have a tiny business because there are not many children around. This does not mean that you cannot make a go of it in Tiny Town, but it does mean that the other two factors, size and layout, become even more important to you as you\n\nFor most prospective gym owners the choice of location will fall somewhere in between these two extremes. We have already looked at two extremes at the lower end of population density and income levels, now let’s take a look at the high end of both. From an income-generating perspective there can be no better location for a gymnastics business than in the growing, affluent, high-population areas spreading outward from our major cities. The endless suburbs are\n\n109\n\nBest Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nwhat we are talking about and many gym businesses are thriving in such a environment. Within this suburban environment several specific factors come into play that should impact your decision on where to locate. 1. Convenience is the ultimate determination of where most of your prospective customers will send their children for their gymnastics lessons so make sure your gym is convenient. The biggest convenience factor is a short drive. Try to locate in the center of the suburban area so there is hous- ing all around you. It is often cheaper to locate on the edge of town but if you make this choice you make your gym convenient for a much smaller percentage of the families in the area. 2. To the extent that you can, locate in an area that is already supporting other businesses and facilities that cater to children and their families. If there are already thriving dance schools, martial arts academies, soccer facilities, swimming pools, day care centers, elementary schools, and so on try to locate in this area. Such a terrific location provides the convenience of “one-stop-shopping” for your families, great exposure as families pour into this area and find your gym, and the peace of mind that comes from locating your new gym in an area that has proven it can support similar businesses. There is one caution, however. Be very careful if you contemplate locating your new gym close to an existing gymnastics school. Unless you are absolutely positive that you can do a much better job, a job so good that you will pry families away from the existing gym, then think many times before you pit yourself against an established gym. At the very least you are splitting your potential customer base by sharing the pool of potential students with another gymnastics operation. At the worst you commit financial suicide by going up against a large established gym that can fight back by adding space, programs, equipment, and staff that you will be hard pressed to match as a start up business. Large and successful gyms are large and successful for a reason. Think hard before you locate within 5-10 miles of a thriving gymnastics school. 3. Even if you cannot locate in an area full of child- centered businesses and programs you can look to locate in an area that draws plenty of families for other reasons. Grocery stores, home improvement centers, and drug stores generate loads of traffic and are good ways to help your potential families find you. 110\n\n4."

        "There are two major drawbacks to this type of space. First, you will have little exposure within the broader community which means that you will have to advertise more. Second, to the extent that your children and families have to com- pete with large trucks for space within the park- ing area you will create a huge turn-off for many customers. Plenty of successful gyms have located in these types of complexes but times and expecta- tions change and you should be careful. 5. Finally, be aware of natural and man-made barri- ers that make any location less convenient. If you have choices within a good area pay attention to the factors than can make your otherwise terrific location tough for your customers. Barriers such as rivers, freeways, and mountains often have few ways to get across and these choke points may cause your potential customers to have to drive a long way to get to you. Of critical importance is traffic. No one wants to sit in massive traffic jams in order to get their kids to gymnastics. Most gyms are too big and the parking lots too\n\nsmall. According the results of the Member Club survey conducted in the summer of 2006, the average gym in the United States is over 15,000 sq/ft. The average gym enrollment in the USA stands at around 500 chil- dren. There is no way to put this delicately. In the vast majority of cases an enrollment of 500 students cannot support a gym that is 15,000 sq/ft, or larger, in size. The owners of these types of gyms are, on average, not making much of a profit based on their investment of time, effort, and money. So, how big should your new gym be? Since everyone’s situation is somewhat different it is difficult to provide specific answers. But if the national averages are used as a starting point some general standards can be presented. The first standard has to be the recognition of the fact that 500 students can easily be accommodated in a gym that is 10,000 sq/ft in size or smaller. This is true even when the gym offers a competitive team pro- gram. In fact, a very general rule-of-thumb can provide a quick approximation of how much space is actually needed. As a starting point consider 10 sq/ft for each student a good estimation. Thus, a gym with an enrollment of 250 students should be able to operate effectively and efficiently in a gym of 2,500 sq/ft. Five hundred students: 5,000 sq/ft. One thousand students: 10,000 sq/ft. and so on. Best Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nIt may seem difficult if not impossible to operate a gym, let alone a competitive team, in such a modest gym. Doing so is neither easy nor convenient, which probably explains why so few even make the attempt. But those who have an interest in both doing a fine job with their students and making a good living for themselves would not operate in any other way. Another way to think about the relationship between\n\nthe size of the gym and the size of the enrollment is to consider the implications of a very simple number. That number is “gross income per square foot.”\n\nIn order to determine that number divide the total revenue earned each year through the normal opera- tions of the gym by the total square feet of the facility. If the gym takes in $500,000 and the gym operates in a 15,000 sq/ft facility, the equation looks like this: $500,000 / 15,000 = $33.33. According to the National Member Club Survey gym owners who reported annual income per square foot of $40.00 or less made less than $50,000 a year through the operation of their gymnastics business. Those that reported income levels at $25.00 per square foot or less earned less than $25,000 a year. It was only when income levels reached $50.00 or more per square foot that compensation levels for gym owners climbed above $75,000 a year. Only about 25% of the Nation’s gym owners achieved this level of income. In the vast majority of cases the gyms in the sur- vey operated in facilities that were too large for the number of students enrolled. Overhead and operating costs including rent, utilities, maintenance, insurance, equipment, and so on can be overwhelming. This is particularly true in the summer when children typically head outdoors leaving the gym to struggle with low enrollment for three months of the year. So, how big should the gym be? It should be big enough to provide an outstanding learning environment for the students while still allow- ing the gym owner to realistically achieve income levels at $50.00 per square foot or more. If we assume an average enrollment of 500 students\n\nwith 50% of those students enrolled in preschool classes, 40% in recreation classes, and 10% in com- petitive team programs then the gym should probably plan to offer the following equipment and space:\n\n1. Administrative and support facilities totaling no more than 20% of the total square footage."

        "This space includes restrooms, waiting area, office and counter space, storage, and a waiting sibling play area. A staff lounge area is a nice luxury but it is a luxury. Many successful gym owners do not con- sider\tthe\twaiting\tsibling\tplay\tarea\ta\tluxury. (1,750)\n\n111\n\n2. Floor space is the single most important area in the gym. A\tcompetition\tfloor\tmeasures\t42’\tX\t42’. This\t is the absolute minimum that should be provided for\tfloor. A\tcompetition\tcheer\tfloor\tmeasures\t42’\tX\t 54’\t\t(USASF)\tand\tproviding\ta\tfloor\tthis\tsize\tallows\t for the addition of cheerleading training which is a very good idea and it also adds additional floor space that can always be put to good use. If the additional cheer floor space is thought of as a side- panel then extending that side-panel into a 54’-60’ spring-strip makes a lot of sense. This extension in- stantly adds an additional tumbling station in your gym and it allows the gymnasts to perform full-out floor routines while still permitting other gymnasts to tumble. This spring-strip can also empty into a pit. (2,500)\n\n3. According to the assumptions made above ap- proximately half of a successful gym’s enrollment can and should come from preschool students. Therefore, you simply must dedicate space to the preschool program. If you decide to organize your preschool classes to make use of creative circuits that\tare\tset\tup\teach\tweek\tin\tthe\tgym\t(a\tvery\tgood\t idea)\tthen\ta\tsuccessful\tgym\twill\tmake\tuse\tof\tat\t least two such circuits each class whenever one, two, or three classes are running. It takes 1,200 sq/ft to organize two terrific circuits. It can take as much as 1,600 sq/ft to organize three circuits. If your preschool students do their music and theme inspired warm-ups on the spring floor then perhaps they can make use of the side-panel added for cheerleading. If not, then the gym owner must dedicate space to provide a warm-up area for the preschool\tstudents. (1,200)\n\n4. A\tsimple\tvaulting\tstation\trequires\t100’\tX\t8’\tat\ta\t bare minimum if you are ever going to train op- tional level gymnasts. If optional level gymnasts are not an issue then less can work just fine. Depend- ing on the gym layout the vaulters can also run across the spring floor making use of the spring strip\tif\tthat\thas\tbeen\textended\tto\t60’. (800)\n\n5. The bar area should provide at least three training stations. A typical set-up would include two sets of uneven bars and a single bar. Use space savers to make the foot print of the bars as small as possible. Try to set them up in a single line to save on mat- ting and floor space. A tight set-up used for recre- ation students and compulsory level gymnasts can fit\tin\tan\tarea\t12’\tX\t44’. Optional\tlevel\tcompetitors\t will require additional space. Additional single bars or a star-bar is a smart addition for the recreation students. (525)\n\nBest Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\n6. The balance beam area should provide at least four beams. Additional beams cut down on lines and waiting time. A mixture of low, medium, and high beams is ideas. Dismount areas at the end of the beams is not necessary for all the beams. In fact, unless you are training optional level athletes it might not be necessary at all. Plan of 6’ be- tween each beam and be sure to provide padded, unobstructed space at the end of the beams in the event\tof\ta\tfall. (600)\n\n6.

Trampolines are an absolute must for a success- ful gym school. The children love trampolines. Gymnastics is a very difficult sport and trampolines provide an easy and fun event each week on which every child can experience some success. Trampo- lines will keep your students coming back. Some guidelines:\t(320) a. Do not make use of round back-yard trampo- lines. You must differentiate your professional gymnastics program from these non-profes- sional pieces of junk. b. Seriously consider making use of at least two\n\ntrampolines so that the kids get twice as many turns. Three would be better. c. You need not offer competition grade tram-\n\npolines. Plenty of companies offer trampolines with\tbeds\tthat\tare\t6’\tX\t12’. d. Make the trampolines super safe. Either put\n\nthem in the ground, surround them with base- ball netting, or construct decking around them so the children cannot fall off. Thus far the administrative areas, floor space,\n\npreschool areas, and equipment come to about 8,000 square feet. If you were to add nothing extra a well organized gym could easily provide lessons and team training to 500-1,000 students in this space. See how in the next section, How I Should Layout The Gym. If you are skeptical that 1,000 children can train in a\n\ngym that is 8,000 square feet, then consider this. This payout provides space for three groups of pre- school students to take class at the same time. If we assume three classes with six students in class at a time then 18 children can take class at a time. Four 45-min- ute classes can be conducted in a three-hour block of time so 72 children can take class each evening from 4:30-7:30. If preschool classes are offered every evening as well\n\nas on Saturday morning then 360 preschool students can take class on Monday through Thursday evenings plus Saturday morning. Add another 140 students taking preschool classes during the day and this gym\n\n112\n\nThis gym can also offer four classes at a time for girls\n\nsince the gym can put a group on vault, bars, beam, and floor. Actually, there is additional room available on trampoline and a second group could make use of the floor, but for this example only four groups will be considered at a time. Four groups with eight students in a group means that 32 girls can take class at the same time. Depending on class length at least three class times can be offered each night Mon-Thursday with additional classes offered on Saturday morning. This means that 480 girls a week can take class using this type of organization. Thus far nothing has been scheduled for Friday night,\n\nSaturday afternoon, or at any time on Sunday. These times have traditionally been used for competition team training. These athletes pay much less per hour than the recreational children do and one of the trade- offs for those lower tuition rates is training slotted for non-prime time hours in the gym. This “free” time can also used quite effectively for birthday parties. It is true that most gyms cannot count on full classes all the time. But it is also true that half the gyms across the country put seven children in preschool classes and nine in school-age classes. Do the math and discover how many additional students can be added making this one simple adjustment to your gym organiza- tion. There is also additional free space in the gym at the beginning and end of the evening during which additional classes can be offered for cheerleaders, for trampoline and tumbling, boys’ classes, and so on. The single biggest obstacle to operating your gym in\n\nthis way could come from a lack of parking places. If three groups of preschool students and four groups of school age children are taking class at the same time then 50 parking places will be required if every par- ent parks and enters the gym. If some of these classes begin and end at the same time then many additional spaces will be required for the overlap. Add in staff parking and a thriving gym will require close to 100 parking places. Should the gym owner want to add in-ground pits,\n\nboy’s equipment, or other items an additional 2,000 square feet should provide the space necessary and would bring the total square footage to 10,000 square feet. The only reason to make the jump from an 8,000- 10,000 sq/ft gym to one that is 15,000 square feet is to provide separate training space that would allow two groups to train at the same time on vault, bars, beam, and floor. This might also be the case if a competitive boys’ team had to operate at the same time as a gym full of girls’ teams and classes. Best Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nHOW SHOULD I LAYOUT THE GYM? Many gym owners coached competitive gymnastics\n\nteams prior to opening their own gyms. Many others were competitive gymnasts themselves or had children in competition prior to opening their gyms. In most cases these gym owners organized their gyms around the competitive team. This might be a mistake. While coaching or offering a competitive team might\n\nbe the driving force behind opening a gym in the first place, please consider that offering a quality competi- tive program is very difficult if the gym is not making enough money to hire and retain terrific coaches, pro- vide new equipment when the old wears out, or when the electricity is shut off. It is impossible to do any job at all when the gym goes out of business. Be smart and plan your profit-making gym space\n\nfirst. Many gymnastics equipment manufacturers and\n\nretailers\toffer\tcomputer-assisted\tdesign\t(CAD)\tdrawings\t that can help you layout the facility and maximize your use of floor space. Using a design template such as this can really save time, energy, and reduce the possibility of critical mistakes."

        "Contact your vendor to see if they offer this design service. Apparatus and equipment\n\nThe decision of whether to buy, lease, rent, or bor- row equipment may depend on your business plan and your confidence level in the success of your business. Acquisition of equipment is very important and we can probably go back to our buying a car analogy: you have many options and there are advantages and disadvan- tages to each. Buying equipment outright ensures that you get what you want, it is yours, and you may be able to get a better price deal from a vendor for an outright purchase. The disadvantage is that like automobiles, the depreciation on gymnastics equipment is quick and severe. Leasing equipment is another option, as is trying to arrange a lease-purchase agreement."
    ],
    [
        "This provides you with probably more equipment than you could afford outright but locks you into a long term financial com- mitment. There are often opportunities to purchase used\n\nequipment at reduced prices from a multitude of sourc- es. You may be able to find a lot of good equipment at reasonable prices but may end up having to arrange for transporting the equipment or picking it up yourself. Another drawback is that you might find yourself with a bunch of extra apparatus you don’t really want or need and carrying the burden of storing or disposing of equipment you can’t use. 113\n\nWhat you need to outfit your gym\n\nBasically, a gymnastics center needs the basics of gymnastics apparatus – floor exercise, vault, balance beams, uneven bars, parallel bars, rings, pommel horse, and horizontal bar. You certainly do not need all of the Olympic equipment; if you are planning to operate only a boys program for example, you would not need bal- ance beams or if your plans are for a girls program only, you would not need parallel bars. If you expect to run a preschool or recreational program with a mix of boys and girls, there are benefits of having your gym outfit- ted with at least one piece of each Olympic apparatus. Every gym should probably have the basics of a floor exercise area, a handful of balance beams, a set of bars, a vaulting board or two, a trampoline or tumble track\t(well-supervised),\tand\tsome\tancillary\tcondition- ing and preschool type equipment such as dynabands, balls, hoops, parachutes, etc. The first consideration you need to make regarding what equipment to buy is what image you want your gym to project. A preschool-focused gym may not need multiple sets of competitive apparatus but it is a good idea to have at least one piece of each just to distinguish your gym as a gymnastics center rather than a day care center or a dance studio. Even the move to “creative movement centers” and “children’s fitness centers” would benefit from the placement of Olym- pic gymnastics equipment. Identify your gym with the sport of gymnastics and you will be able to reap the benefits of collateral exposure during televised events and USAG promotions. All of that stated, the image you develop for your gym may include walls painted with cartoon characters or inspirational quotes – depending on how you plan to market your business. If your focus is on preschool, you will need equipment designed for children under the age of six. Do not try to conduct preschool classes on apparatus designed for older athletes and competitive activities. The same idea holds true for recreational and competitive activities; don’t try to conduct classes and workouts with older children on equipment designed for preschool age children under 85 pounds. Purchase equipment based on the planned activity."

Your brand says a lot about you and your business, and that’s as true for a local gymnastics gym as it is for a multi- national conglomerate. In this article we look at how creating a strong brand for your business can help you set yourself apart and lay the right foundation for the growth of your business. What Is A Brand? Your brand is more than just your business name or\n\nexplaining who you are, what you do and how you do it. Your brand can already communicate that for you. You can spend your time focusing on students rather than educating your customers about your business. How Do You Create Your Own Brand? Your brand needs to say who you are, what you do\n\nand how you do it. It needs to do all these things at the same time as establishing your relevance to your prospective customers. It is absolutely essential as you build your own brand, that you have a firm grasp of who you are, what you do and how you do it. If not, you’re going to send mixed messages to your clients and your legitimacy will be in question. the logo on your newspaper ad. It is your corporate identity. An effective brand tells people who you are, what you do and how you do it, while at the same time establishing your relevance to your customers. Your brand is how your business is perceived by customers. If your brand has a high perceived value, you enjoy many advantages over your competition, especially when it comes to pricing. Why do you think people are prepared to pay exorbitant money for brand items? Perceived value; perceived value as a result of very effective brand promotion resulting in high recog- nition. This does not mean that every gym needs to create a brand that will be recognized worldwide, but rather, that it is possible for your brand to dominate your niche market. Start with your mission statement."
    ],
    [
        "What is the mis-\n\nsion of your business? Obviously you’re in business to make a profit. Making a profit is a by-product of a successful business. Focus on your core values and the profits will follow. A good place to begin thinking about your mission is to put yourself in the shoes of your customers. If you’re in the market for a gymnastics club, what things are important to you? Different people will be looking for different benefits but you can bet that they want their child to be safe and well cared for. Cost is also likely to be high on the list as is the training they will receive. These things will be highly important to some and less important to others. So focus on the benefits that are likely to be highly relevant to the majority of your tar- get market. For our purposes, we will be using safety and skill-training education. Why Do You Need To Create A Brand? The main reason for creating your own brand is to differentiate yourself from your competition. Gymnas- tics programs can be located blocks apart from each other. You need to constantly be looking for ways to set yourself apart from your competition."
    ],
    [
        "Your brand can do that for you. Another good reason for creating your own brand is\n\nto make your marketing more effective and efficient. You don’t have to spend your time with a new client\n\nYour mission statement might read something like “We Create Champions in the Safest Gymnastics Train- ing Center in the Midwest.” That’s a pretty general statement and if you decide to focus on a particular niche of the gymnastics market, such as Girls Compul- sory levels, you may want to more narrowly focus on that group in your mission statement. Now that you’ve written your mission statement, you can begin think- ing about creating a brand that reinforces and supports your mission. You can now begin to think of your busi-\n\n115\n\nBest Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nness using the fundamental questions of who you are, what you do, and how you do it. You’re a gymnastics center; you safely teach children gymnastics and train them to compete successfully performing compulsory routines and earning championships. When you create your brand, you need to keep the\n\nwho, what and how firmly in mind but also use the brand to establish your relevance to your target market and build credibility with that market. List your busi- ness’s key features and characteristics, your competitive advantages and anything else that sets you apart from your competition. Using our Girls Compulsory example, you’ll focus primarily on the objectives from your mission state- ment namely, safety, girls compulsory competition and championships. Identify and Describe Your Target Market. Decide whether you want to target the entire gymnastics com- munity or only a segment of it such as “six to ten year old girls.”\n\nInclude the key elements from your mission state- ment. The key elements from your mission statement were safety, children, girls, compulsory competition and championships. Find names that are suggestive of these elements."
    ],
    [
        "Don’t limit yourself to real words, though. A coined name with no obvious meaning is a perfectly legitimate name provided it conveys something about your business. You will find coined names easier to trademark and secure website domain names for too. Let’s use GymChamps for our example. Use tag lines that reinforce your mission statement. You could use something like: “GymChamps – Mid- west Level 6 champions since 1999” or “Gym- Champs – Teaching Safe Gymnastics First, Second and Always.”\n\nHow Should You Use Your Brand? Your logo is not your brand, but your logo should allow your brand to be instantly recognized by those familiar with it."
    ],
    [
        "To this extent, your logo helps create and reinforce brand awareness. The logo you create should be able to be used\n\nconsistently in a variety of different media. It should be suitable for corporate letterhead and business cards, as well as for your website and any signs. You don’t want a confusing mishmash of logos and banners and heav- en knows what else. Everything you produce needs to use the same, consistent style of logo so that your logo becomes synonymous with your brand. Instant recogni- tion is what you’re going for, so don’t dilute it by using several different logos for different purposes. Establish consistent usage of your gym name, logo and tag line. Put the brand name and tagline together, the physical manifestation of your brand will be:\n\n116\n\nGymChamps ”We Create Champions in the Safest Gymnastics Training Center in the Midwest”\n\nTo establish brand awareness, this branding needs to be used consistently and frequently in everything you produce, whether that is letters to clients, business cards, brochures, invoices, advertising, promotions, on your website, on the front door of your gym and on any personalized products you sell or give away. Also be consistent in your use of fonts and color schemes. These can be powerful in making your brand easily recognizable. Once you’ve created your brand, you need to market\n\nand promote it, in addition to your regular services. This is how you establish your credibility and relevance to your customers and potential customer market. Hopefully you can see why your brand needs to be sug- gestive of your mission statement. If, at the same time as you’re selling your products and services you also push your brand, your brand becomes synonymous with your products and services and vice versa. CUSTOMER SERvICE\n\nThe adage “The customer is always right” may not be true but “The customer is our reason for being here and deserves our attention” is true. The Golden Rule is probably the best advice I can give in regard to cus- tomer service. Treat a client with respect and they will usually respond with respect. Take the time to listen and help a customer whenever possible. We do not believe in an “It’s not my job” attitude. If we can help, we will – with a smile. Customer Service at the Counter\n\nA customer who has taken the time to stop in and\n\nvisit us in person deserves our undivided attention (first\tcome,\tfirst\tserved\tof\tcourse). In\tthe\tevent\tyou\tare\t helping someone and another customer walks up to the counter, at the first opportunity, acknowledge the new customer with a friendly “I’ll be right with you” or a nod and a smile at the very least and return to the first customer. When the phone rings while you are working with a client, kindly excuse yourself to answer the phone with, “Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening Menlo Park Community Services, this is...can you hold please? I will be with you as soon as possible.” and re- turn to finish the walk-up customer. If we can help, we will - with a smile."

        "If you cannot answer a customer’s question or accommodate their request, refer them to someone who can help or offer to take their name, telephone number, and all other important information so that we can call them later. Best Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nCustomer Service on the Phone\n\nA person who calls deserves to have their questions\n\nanswered with courtesy and helpfulness. When the phone rings, cheerfully answer the phone with, “Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening Gymnastics Center, this is...how may I help you?” If we can help, we will - with a smile. If you cannot answer a customer’s question or accommodate their request, refer them to someone who can help or offer to take their name, telephone number, and all other important information so that we can call them later. When the phone rings while you are working with a customer, kindly excuse yourself to answer the phone with, “Good Morning/After- noon/Evening Gymnastics Center, this is...can you hold please? I will be with you as soon as possible.” and return to finish the walk-up customer. Take the time to learn the phone message system for your gym. If you have voice mail box system, know how to put a caller on hold and connect them to the system. If you transfer a call to Voice Mail, inform the caller that you are transferring to Voice Mail. Always return phone messages within one working day. There is a sample Customer Service Policy and values\n\nstatement in the Appendix for your consideration. It is important for you to share your values and expecta- tions with the staff that represent you. Create a cus- tomer service policy for your organization to follow. IS FEAR HOLDING YOU BACk? What’s the thing that stops countless people from re- alizing ultimate professional success? Fear - we all have it. Fear in business can take on many faces. Owners can fear adding staff or raising fees. It’s not the fear of the employee or the fear of losing a customer or two. It’s the fear of the employee or the increase not working out and losing the investments. Managers sometimes fear disciplining unacceptable employee behaviors. Why? Because they fear the employee will make a scene or quit. Humans have an important protection instinct — fight\n\nor flight. When we fear something that we believe can harm us, our body has two primary reactions: fight (stand\tup\tto\tthe\tfear)\tor\tflight\t(distance\tourselves\tas\tfar\t away\tfrom\tthe\tfear\tas\tpossible). As humans however, we have an even more power- ful ability to analyze and understand. We can step back from our fear and determine if it is worthy of the flight instinct. Maybe we have given it more power than it deserves and conquering this fear will bring us business rewards. 117\n\nTop business performers have developed a multi-step approach to conquering their fears that can help you as well. First, ask yourself a few important questions. Try\tto\tidentify\twhat\tyou\tactually\tfear. Ask\tyour- self what’s the worst that can happen if you fail. I wouldn’t want to ask myself that question performing a super E skill on bars, but most of the time in business it’s either a fear of loss or a fear of potential embarrassment. Next,\tidentify\twhat\tyou\tcould\tgain\tif\tthis\ttask\tor\t strategy works out well. This positive vision helps overshadow the negative fear. Lastly,\task\tyourself\twhat\tthe\tprice\tis\tif\tyou\tdon’t overcome this fear. Next, top performers use what’s called desensitizing or more simply stated - positive action. They do what they fear and each time they do it, they fear it less and less. This positive momentum breaks the initial immobi- lizing hold that fear can have on you. Remember when you were learning a new gymnastics skill? Remember the fear? The actual fear of course was falling and getting hurt. The upside was learning the new skill and performing it. This position can be called taking a ‘counter-phobic’ stance and attacking what we fear. Role-playing, practicing or somehow improving your technique are ways to desensitize yourself. A business owner can run a quick financial analysis by her accoun- tants or other financial advisors. This will give time to check the soundness of an idea before taking action."

        "Managers will do better if they role-play with some- one in advance, running through different employee reactions, including the dreaded tears or even anger. Once you are able to successfully stay calm and clearly explain your position, you will feel more confident and therefore, do a better job. Great entrepreneurs are willing to take risks and be innovative. With the new “post-Olympic bump” in en- rollments, NOW is a great time to challenge your fears. I know of one gym owner that added a new registra- tion fee and another gym owner that raised fees by almost 15% to increase revenues. Overcoming fear is a lifelong quest. Ask yourself, ‘What’s the worst that can happen to me if I fail?’ There are two types of people: those who try, stumble and get up and try again and those who fear stumbling and never even try. Which type is more likely to be suc- cessful in gymnastics, business, and life?

A winner goes through a problem; A loser goes around it, and never gets past it. A winner makes commitments; A loser makes promises. A winner says, “I’m good, but not as good as I ought to be.” A loser says, “I’m not as bad as a lot of other people.”\n\nA winner listens; A loser just waits until it’s his turn to talk. A winner respects those who are superior to him and tries to learn something from them; A loser resents those who are superior to him and tries to find chinks in their armor.

Best Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nDEALING WITH THE MEDIA – PRESS RELEASES\n\nThere are two situations that will bring a news reporter to your gym – a special interest opportunity or a tragedy. Dealing with the media in either situation can be difficult to handle appropriately. You most likely won’t be asked the same questions in these two sce- narios, but in each case, you should be well-prepared and make the best of it. How you present yourself to the media can be a tremendous boost to your business or absolutely destroy it. This month I would like to offer some thoughts on “welcome news” and trying to get your organization some positive notice by the media. If you have ever submitted a “press release” to your local newspaper and been disappointed when you got no response, rest assured you are not alone. A lot of gym owners think that every Level 5 State champion or Regional team qualifier in their gym should receive feature coverage. Your newspaper or TV news editor may not agree."

If there is a lot going on, the competition for space may limit your chances of getting published. Your press release may get lost in the shuffle of a busy news week. Trends – Is there a hot new fad that is getting a lot of attention lately?"

        "Are you riding that wave and deserve a little recognition for your contribu- tion to the cool lifestyle? Tie-Ins – National Gymnastics Day provides a great chance to get some exposure. State, Nation- al, Regional or World Championships may provide you opportunities to tie into these major events. Is there a community event that you can be a part of that would put you in front of the public eye? Public service events like Cancer Cartwheel-A- Thons and volunteer service activities are always good for added exposure. Tags – People that make your business special – your employees or your customers can give you a chance to tag into their notoriety. Do you have a staff member that has another interesting side to their life? Can you tag onto an announcement about your gym hosting a KAT or Safety Certifica- tion Workshop and expand to include additional details about your program? Are there any celebri- ties\t(local,\tregional,\tnational)\tin\tyour\tprogram\tthat\t would allow you to use them as endorsement figures? 119\n\nDon’t be afraid to engage in a little self-promotion. If you don’t believe enough in your business to tell other people how great you are, nobody else will. When writing and submitting a press release, a few tips may get you moved up the priority list. Make sure your announcements are:\n\nCorrect – Double check to make sure that your information is 100% accurate. Brief – Sometime shorter is better, as many newspapers receive hundreds of announcements, letters and releases a day, so you will have more chance to get published. Focus on one major topic. Also make your main point as early on in the release as possible, as editors will tend to cut a story if they are running short of space. Clear – Your press release must make sense. Remember that while you may know a great deal about Gymnastics, not all editors or newspaper readers will. Personal – You are more likely to be published if the release contains personal knowledge, interest or experience. Provide photographs if possible. Complete – Make the reporter/editor’s job as easy\tas\tpossible. Provide\tthem\twith\twritten\t(typed,\t double\tspaced)\tcopy\tand\tdigital\tcopy\t(on\tdisk\tor\t via\te-mail)\tas\twell. Always\tinclude\tyour\tcontact\t details; name, address, phone numbers, fax num- ber, e-mail address. Make yourself available to be interviewed. If the opportunity presents itself to engage in posi- tive publicity, take it for all it’s worth. Be prepared with ready answers to probable questions and a couple of choice sound bytes that will look good in the paper or sound good when quoted.

THE ROLE OF GYMNASTICS PARENTS IN THE GYM\n\nA study led by Benjamin Bloom in 1985, Develop- ing Talent in Young People, looked at how talent manifests and is developed in young people. The study divided\tthe\tcareers\tof\ttalented\tyoung\tpeople\t(in\tart,\t music,\tmathematics\tand\tsports)\tinto\tthree\tstages:\tearly,\t middle and later. Using terminology from Alfred North Whitehead, we call them the Romantic, the Technical, and the Mature stages. The Romantic Stage is the beginning. The child just loves the sport. She can’t wait to get to the gym; she practices her cartwheels and handstands at every opportunity. The child experiences im- mediate success. She is better at this activity than her peers, which increases her enthusiasm for participating in it. As Bloom puts it for the swim- mers he studied, “these are the years of playful encounter with the sport…”Enjoyment is critical. “Had there been no excitement during the early years…there would never have been a middle or later period.” One swimmer remarked, “Practices were fun…you’re having so much fun that you don’t realize you’re exhausted.” A child’s self-ap- praisal\tof\tability\t(self-esteem)\tis\tdirectly\trelated\tto\t a parent’s judgment of their child’s physical ability (Felson\t&\tReed,\t1986). 121\n\nAs a child’s perceived competency in gymnastics is a key factor in continued participation on to the next stage of development; two factors are critical – successful task completion and parental support\t(Horn\t&\tHarris,\t1996). At\ta\tcertain\tpoint,\t someone, often a parent, but typically a recruiting coach, notices talent in the child, this often leads to the middle or Technical Stage. The Technical Stage is inaugurated by the ap- pearance of the technically-proficient coach who is brought into the picture to ensure that things are done correctly. The transition from sport as fun to developing the proper technique is where many kids drop out. As the focus moves to technical proficiency, all too often the sport becomes more like a job and less like a wonderfully fun experi- ence. The joy goes out of the experience, and the child removes himself from the sports experience as soon as he is able. As children enter this stage, parental feedback\n\ncontinues to be critical in shaping their child’s self- perception\t(Stipek\t&\tMacIver,\t1989). It\tis\timpor- tant that the parent’s feedback be directed toward task completion rather than comparisons to others or the correct technique. In other words, leave the coaching to the coaches. Parents must remain involved in a firm and consistent manner, enforc- ing guidelines, limits and appropriate expectations (Baumrind,\t1978). The Mature Stage – Here the child has devel- oped her talent to the point where she is perform- ing at a high level on a grand stage at the national or maybe even the worldwide level. Most kids never make it to this stage. Why? For some, it is a lack of talent or interest, but a majority of the kids who do have the talent do not make it to this stage because they have lost the joy in playing, which powers the commitment and effort needed to become great. Most youth with talent never reach the Mature Stage because fun is sacrificed in the technical stage. Perhaps the most important lesson for parents here is that you need to manage the tran- sition from the Romantic to the Technical Stage. Make sure your child isn’t rushed into the Techni- cal Stage. A child expected to “work” at the sport too soon is more likely to turn off and never reach the Mature Stage. Best Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nFocusing too early on technique can drain the\n\nenjoyment that fuels the drive for excellence. A parent should provide their children with a variety of oppor- tunities and multiple chances to achieve success in the early\tyears\tof\tsport\tparticipation\t(McCullagh,\tMatzka- nin,\tShaw\t&\tMoldanado,\t1993). Parents\tneed\tto\toffer\t lots of positive feedback. There are drawbacks though; research indicates that as peer comparisons become increasingly more important to the young athlete, by about the age of 9, children become more evaluative of parent feedback. If positive feedback is not accu- rate, does not match performance, then the parent’s involvement could actually be detrimental to the child’s perception\tof\ttheir\tsport\tcompetence\t(Horn\t&\tHarris,\t 1996). Parents\tmust\tgive\tencouraging\tbut\thonest\tand\t accurate feedback. Talent is not often obvious at an early age. Bloom stated: “One of the most startling discoveries of our study has been that it takes a while to recognize swim- ming talent.” Only 10% or less of the athletes could be confidently identified as gifted by the age of 11 or 12. One coach didn’t recognize how talented a swimmer was\teven\tafter\tworking\twith\ther\tfor\tfive\tyears\t(she\t went\ton\tto\tmake\tthe\tOlympics). Remember,\tKathy\t Johnson\t(bronze\tmedalist\ton\tfloor\texercise,\t1978\tWorld\t Championships and team silver medalist and balance beam\tbronze\tmedalist,\t84\tOlympics)\tdid\tnot\tbegin\ther\t gymnastics career until she was 13 years old – fairly late considering the talent she subsequently demonstrated. Many kids have great potential. Support makes the difference: Perhaps the most interesting assertion Bloom\tmakes\tis\tmost\tchildren\t(95%)\thave\tthe\tability\tto\t approximate the achievements of the talented youth with proper encouragement. What is the difference between the children who reach the stage where their talent blooms forth and those who don’t? These children experienced something from their parents that seemed to make a huge difference. “So far as we can tell, this willingness to give encour-\n\nagement\tand\tsupport\ton\tthe\tpart\tof\tthe\tparents\t(and\t siblings)\tis\tone\tof\tthe\tmajor\tdistinctions\tbetween\tthe\t families of these Olympic swimmers and other fami- lies.”\n\n“No\tmatter\twhat\tthe\tinitial\tcharacteristics\t(or\tgifts)\t of the individuals, unless there is a long and intensive process of encouragement, nurturance, education and training, the individuals will not attain extreme levels of capabilities in these particular fields.” The research is very clear – what a parent says and does have a tremendous influence on their child. The more you as a parent support your children, the more your children will reach the highest level of talent development pos- sible for them. 122\n\nSAMPLE Parent Responsibilities\n\nAll parents must sign out children in the program before the child leaves the program for the day. The parents must sign their full signature, not their initials. It is the staff responsibility to sign in each child daily. Parents are welcome to observe the program at any\n\ntime. Parents are expected to pick their children up im- mediately following class. If a child is not picked up, it is mandatory that the senior staff member stays in the designated area until the child is picked up. Do not leave the child unattended! After 15 minutes you must call the parents; if there is no answer, leave a message both at work and home. PARTNERS NOT PROBLEMS – kEEPING PARENTS OFF YOUR BACk AND ON YOUR SIDE\n\nResearch has proven that children whose parents are involved in their education are more likely to have higher academic achievement and better social skills than children whose parents are not a part of their education. When teachers communicate and col- laborate with the fam ilies of the children they teach everyone benefits. This carries through to a child’s athletic achievement as well. A child whose parents are actively involved in their development and support their progress will achieve more in less time. When families are involved in the learning process, they have greater access to teachers and a network of other parents and several positive things occur. Fami- lies:\n\nDevelop\ta\tbetter\tunderstanding\tof\tpolicies\tand curriculum\n\nHave\tmore\tappropriate\texpectations\tfor\ttheir child’s development and better understand their child’s abilities and skills\n\nAre\tmore\tappreciative\tof\tteacher\tefforts\n\nWhat price do we have to pay as educators by hav- ing the parents involved? Have you ever had a parent argue with you in an attempt to enter a specific meet or have a parent file a ‘disappointment’ lawsuit be- cause their child doesn’t get enough attention from the head coach? Parents see their child’s success as the key to success in life, and they aren’t shy about expressing themselves. Best Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nWhen families rearrange their schedules for practices\n\nand competitions and spend thousands of dollars to train their children, parents are not always looking at the bigger picture. That’s not how the parents see it, of course. They aren’t being overbearing; they’re “helping.” Parents are convinced the stakes are so high that they can justify doing almost anything to give their child an advan- tage. So how do you deal with “parents who care too much?”\n\nParents often ignore the beneficial effects of failure and believe that if their child experiences any kind of failure their whole lives will be ruined. Experts say par- ents should step back and give the student space. Help parents understand this concept and turn the problem parents into partners. The best place to start is gathering the parents\n\ntogether for a general “focus group” session. Facilitate an open meeting with as many parents as possible to establish effective communication with them by asking three key questions:\n\nWhat\tdo\tyou\tlike\tabout\tour\tprogram\t(what\tdo\twe do\tbest)? What\tdo\tyou\tNOT\tlike\tabout\tour\tprogram\t(what don’t\twe\tdo\twell)? How\tdo\tyou\tfeel\twe\tshould\tchange\t(how\twould you\tdo\tit)? It may feel intimidating opening yourself up to criti-\n\ncism like this but the key is to be sure to include as many different “interest group” parents in this meet- ing as possible. Be sure to set the ground rules at the beginning of the meeting and assure everyone that you are truly interested in their comments. Let everyone know that no promises are being made but you will try to respond to their input with a follow-up meeting with the group after a short time. Above all, tell everyone that their comments will be treated with respect and they should participate freely. What typically occurs is as you lead the discussion you will find that as one parent complains about your work-out schedule, another parent will express how much they love the schedule. As one parent calls you to task for too many meets, another parent will ask for more\tcompetitions\t(sound\tfamiliar?). If\tthe\tparents\tlove\t the teachers and coaches, maybe they can suggest ways to recognize the staff that won’t cost you any money. If the parents don’t like the way the gym is arranged or the lack of certain equipment, you may find that they are willing to help rearrange the gym or coordinate some fundraising to help you purchase new bars. 123\n\nEveryone likes to be part of a solution to a prob- lem. When everything is said and done, parents have a better understanding and greater respect for your position trying to please as many interests as possible. They appreciate your efforts to listen and address their concerns whether you meet their needs or not. The next step is to engage staff in your effort and get\n\nthem to help you create a “family-friendly” operation that welcomes parental involvement and invites coop- eration. Coaches need to learn that parents aren’t the enemy – that together with the parents, they can help the athlete grow to achieve more than if the coach or parent carries an adversarial attitude. Possible solutions include allowing the parent to observe\tall\tworkouts\t(what\tare\tyou\ttrying\tto\thide\t anyway?);\tor\tif\tthe\tgymnast\tworks\tbetter\twithout\tthe\t parent watching, at least engage the parent and child in that decision. Coaches should learn to respect the tal- ents and perspective of the parents. Get the coaches to appreciate appropriate help from a parent – a dad who is a carpenter can help build spotting platforms, a mom that works for the newspaper may help get a feature article published about the team. Involve the parents and let staff know that you want that to be OK. Finally, build alliances with the parents through con- stant communication. Share information at the follow- up meeting about program philosophy, discipline poli- cies, procedures, and any pertinent changes you have made since the focus meeting. Create a suggestion box but don’t stop there, develop an “I’ve got a complaint” form, an “I’ve got an idea” form and an “I’ve got a compliment” letter. Make it easy for the parents to contact you to let you know how they feel. Get out of your office and greet the parents. Host informal coffee hours to get the parents acquainted with one another. Conduct periodic feedback surveys. The key is to not stop communicating. Publish newsletters, web updates, newspaper articles, personal notes, bulletin board announcements, posters, signs and regular meetings, anything you can to spread your message to keep the parents off your back and on your side.

On behalf of USA Gymnastics, I wish you success! 127\n\nBest Practices for the Gymnastics Business\n\nUSA GYMNASTICS UNIvERSITY: EXCELLENCE THROUGH EDUCATION\n\nUSA Gymnastics University was developed to meet the educational needs of people working in the field of gymnastics. Our mission is to provide a multi-level, standardized education program that is available throughout the country and emphasizes the proper development of gymnastics participants in a fun, safe environment. USA Gymnastics University is a collection of educa- tional resources, courses, and a professional certifica- tion program. Education and certification go hand-in- hand. Through education, coaches, instructors, judges, and administrators are better prepared and equipped to work in the world of gymnastics. The certification program aims to organize the educational offerings of USA Gymnastics University and provide a means to achieve logical learning progressions, a well-rounded knowledge base, and national-level recognition of edu- cation, experience levels and competencies. A profes- sional’s pursuit of continuing education demonstrates commitment to professionalism and lifelong learning and a desire to provide a safer, healthier environment for gymnastics participants. “Professionalism today involves more than just expertise and payment for services. Professional- ism also involves periodic review by peers, proof of expertise via sanctioned professional credentials, and constant dedication to improving one’s skills and knowledge.”\n\n– USA Gymnastics Safety Handbook, 2002 edition\n\nWhat does USA Gymnastics University include? When the University is fully developed, it will contain a broad spectrum of educational resources; relevant and timely gymnastics updates; online, live, and other types of course offerings; and additional education links. USA Gymnastics University will provide:\n\nTools\tand\teducation\tfor\tindividuals\tnew\tto\tthe sport and/or coaching\n\nOpportunities\tfor\texperienced\tcoaches\tand instructors to review and continue to build upon their knowledge and skill level\n\nThe\tlatest\tinformation\tin\ta\tvariety\tof\tareas\tinclud- ing program rules, skill techniques, injury and health, safety and more\n\nOpportunities\tto\tbuild\tknowledge\tin\tother\tdisci- plines of gymnastics, as well as in sport manage- ment, sport science, business, and leadership\n\nCertification Program\n\nUSA Gymnastics has developed a professional certifi- cation program designed to accommodate gymnastics professionals of various backgrounds and experience levels and provide the foundations of knowledge across many areas. The purpose of the certification program is to set minimum education standards for the sport, provide sport-specific training as well as training in other domains, and help gymnastics professionals grow and in turn develop well-trained athletes. Certification through USA Gymnastics University is based on the completion of multiple courses, not sim- ply one single course. Each level of certification serves as a foundation of education and a stepping stone to the next level. Certification will be available within four colleges: program, recreational, judge, and business. Each college is comprised of five levels of certification. The first of the USA Gymnastics University certifica- tion levels will be available in early 2009. But some of the core and elective courses are now available – so get started today! Available online courses include:\n\nSafety/Risk Management Certification - The course focuses on risk management, including environ- mental, program and legal factors, as well as sports injury care and special gymnastics safety factors. The course addresses the two basic areas of risk in gymnastics - risk of injury, which is the primary risk, and risk of a lawsuit. Safety/Risk Management Certification helps better prepare the gymnastics professional to be more vigilant and more likely to foresee potential problems. This course is also offered as a live course. First Aid Basics - This course provides basic first aid information specific to the gymnastics setting. It covers injury prevention, common types of gym- nastics injuries and risks and the symptoms and treatment of those injuries. It also includes general information on other life threatening conditions. Preschool Fundamentals: Theory (Part 1) - covers young child development theory in the context of gymnastics movement education. Course top- ics include teaching philosophy, stages of child development, characteristics of a good teacher, class management, safety considerations, skill deconstruction, lesson planning, and program assessment. This course will help instructors better understand their students and better prepare, organize, and run safe and successful preschool classes."

Q: Who must complete the background check?"
    ],
    [
        "A: All USA Gymnastics Professional Members must complete and pass a background check. Profes- sional membership will carry a pending status until the background check and safety certiﬁ cation have been successfully completed. Q: When must the background check be completed? A: New requirements for professional membership began December 1, 2007. Background checks are required for all new/lapsed/expired professional mem- bers. Therefore, if your membership is new or already expired at the time of renewal, the membership will be pending until the background check is completed. All current professional members must complete the back- ground check by their renewal month. Q: What is the cost of the background check? A: The minimum cost of the background check is $20.00 plus a $1.25 processing fee. This cost includes a Full Service Check-it-TwiceTM search package plus one single county search. The cost of the background check may increase depending on the state and/or number of counties or names that are being searched. A full fee schedule is available upon logging into the background screening application. Q.: What if I am given a red light? A: The “red light” indicates an individual does not meet the criteria as suitable for participation as a pro- fessional member of USA Gymnastics. If a question arises concerning a background search, the applicant will be contacted by NCSI and provided with an op- portunity to correct potential errors in the applicant’s record or to provide additional information prior to is- suing a “red light.” In such situations USA Gymnas- tics may also be contacted. Q: Can I contest a red light? A: For an applicant to contest the content of a record provided to the applicant as part of USA Gymnas- tics background check, the applicant may seek an appeal of his/her record with NCSI pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act. USA Gymnastics will use the determination provided by NCSI, in accordance with USA Gymnastics Bylaws Article 9 Membership, to determine an individual’s eligibility for member- ship in USA Gymnastics. Should an individual con- test a USA Gymnastics decision to deny participation based upon a “red light” from the background search, the applicant has the right to appeal the decision pursuant to Article 10 of the USA Gymnastics Bylaws.

A: The screening will need the following information: • social security number (required for veriﬁ cation purposes, background check will not be submitted or completed without this information).

        "What if I am given a green light? A: The “green light” indicates an individual has passed the background search with regard to suitability for participation as a professional mem- ber of USA Gymnastics. Q: How does NCSI determine the counties that need to be searched? A: Applicants are asked to provide name and county history during the NCSI registration process. In addition, a Social Security Number Trace is used to verify the applicant’s information. The SSN Trace reports name and address history associated with a SSN. NCSI will utilize the appli- cant’s submitted information and the SSN Trace to search all names and counties reported in accordance with USAG policy.

        "She\n\nwalked away with a gold medal in the individual all-around finals. She was\n\nthe first African-American gymnast to win gold in that category. Gymnasts who tumble are part of a gymnastics discipline with a long\n\nhistory. Tumbling has roots that extend thousands of years. Ancient\n\ncivilizations performed it as entertainment. These performances took place\n\nin China, Egypt, Greece, and Persia. Tumbling became a sport much later, although it still wasn’t considered\n\npart of gymnastics. Men competed in tumbling only once as a standalone\n\nevent in the 1932 Olympic Games. Today, tumbling is part of the floor exercise artistic gymnastics event. Since the 1952 Olympic Games, both men and women have competed in\n\nthe event. Gymnasts work their skills on the floor and in the air. They\n\nperform challenging moves such as rolls, flips, handsprings, and walkovers. Fast Fact: Men and women gymnasts compete in only two mutual events— floor exercise and vault. The rest of the events in artistic gymnastics are gender-specific. Gabrielle Douglas at the 2012 Olympics\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nFun on the Floor\n\nFloor exercise routines are thrilling to watch, fun to perform, and\n\nchallenging to perfect. It all starts with learning tumbling skills. Experienced gymnasts make tumbling look easy. But don’t be fooled. It\n\ntakes time and tons of practice to get the moves right. All practice should\n\ntake place in a gym with a professional coach or spotter by your side. It’s\n\nthe only way to train safely and prevent injury. Gymnasts can get started by finding a gymnastics club in their area. USA Gymnastics lists member gyms on their website. The Amateur\n\nAthletic Union (AAU) also runs programs and competitions in trampoline\n\nand tumbling as a combined sport. At a club you can connect with a coach. From there you can start\n\nlearning tumbling moves and maybe one day compete in floor exercise. Fast Fact: USA Gymnastics has a combined trampoline and tumbling program. However, in the Olympics, the trampoline program is a separate event. CHAPTER 2\n\nTricks of the Trade\n\nGymnasts start learning basic tumbling skills for floor exercise. They\n\ndevelop the flexibility and strength needed to make shapes with their body. At first, it all takes place on the floor. Basic tumbling skills include:\n\nArabesque\n\nStand on one leg, keeping that leg straight or slightly bent. Extend your\n\narms to your sides."

    [
        "Raise the other leg behind your back, keeping it straight. Forward Roll\n\nSquat on the floor. Bend forward and put your hands on the ground. Tuck your head between your hands. Roll forward so your hips go over\n\nyour head. Keep legs straight and toes pointed. Use your momentum to\n\nfinish in a standing position. Do not use your hands to push yourself up. Stretch First Always prepare your muscles for gymnastic moves by stretching first. Stretching helps improve flexibility so you can perform better. Your coach can teach you specific stretches that will help with each skill. Your coach may even recommend stretches you can safely do at home. Modified Moves\n\nMany basic tumbling skills help gymnasts learn more difficult moves\n\nlater on. Learning a bridge, for example, can help a gymnast learn a\n\nbackbend. Gymnasts also learn more difficult moves by modifying them. For example, they can learn to perform a handstand up against a wall to help\n\nwith balance. Once they gain confidence and ability, they perform the skill without a wall support. After joining a gymnastics club, you’ll likely be practicing these basic\n\nmoves:\n\nBridge\n\nLie on the ground on your back. Bend your knees up and put your hands\n\nby your ears, palms down. Your fingers should be pointing toward your\n\nfeet. Push your body up to create the bridge position. Backbend\n\nStand with legs a little wider than shoulder width apart. Extend your\n\narms over your head. Look up and push your hips forward. Bend backward until your hands reach the floor. Handstand\n\nYou can learn proper handstand form by first using a wall for support. Once you feel comfortable, practice a handstand without the wall. Stand in a lunge position with one leg forward and your arms extended up over your\n\nhead. As you place your hands on the floor, kick your feet over your head. Arms should be straight. Keep your stomach tight."
    ],
    [
        "This will help you\n\nremain balanced. What to Wear Gymnasts wear practice clothing that allows them to move easily. Female gymnasts wear leotards with long, short, or no sleeves. They sometimes wear spandex shorts over their leotards. Male gymnasts usually practice in shorts and a T-shirt or tank top. Gymnasts may wear special gymnastics shoes, socks, or practice in their bare feet. Other footwear is too slippery and considered unsafe. Moves in Motion\n\nGymnasts need to master each basic move. They can try more difficult\n\ntumbling skills as they gain muscle strength, flexibility, and experience. Every skill, whether basic or more difficult, takes training to perfect. Cartwheel\n\nStart in a side lunge position with one leg forward and bent and the other back and straight. Extend your arms over your head. Lean forward to\n\nplace your hands on the ground side by side. At the same time, kick your\n\nlegs up and into a middle split position. Continue toward the direction you\n\nkicked your legs up. Place your feet on the mat one at a time to return to a standing position. Which Split? To perform a middle split, the left leg extends out to the left. The right leg extends out to the right. To perform a side split, extend one leg out in front of you and the other out behind you. Keep your legs straight and point your toes. Back Walkover\n\nStand on the mat and extend one leg in front of you, with your toe\n\ntouching the mat. Extend your arms up. Push your hips forward and bring\n\nyour fingertips back. Bend into a backbend position. Kick your legs up and\n\nover your body into a side split. Let your front foot touch the mat first. End with both feet on the ground. Fast Fact: In competition, all splits and jumps require a 180-degree leg separation. Point deductions depend on how close or far your legs are from 180 degrees. Into the Air\n\nMore advanced tumbling moves can bring you off the mat and into the\n\nair. Some start with a run to gain speed and momentum. Remember, these\n\nmoves can be fun to practice, but they should only be attempted at the gym when you’re working with a coach or spotter. Back Handspring\n\nStand with arms extended up. Swing your arms to gain momentum as\n\nyou sit back and push through your toes onto your hands behind you. Bring\n\nyour feet up into a handstand position. Flip all the way over so you land in\n\nthe same position you started in. Front Handspring\n\nStand with arms extended up. Run a few steps, hop up, and lunge forward to place your hands on the ground in front of you. Kick your legs\n\nup into a handstand position. Flip all the way over so you land in the same\n\nposition you started in. Fast Fact: The floor in a gymnastics gym is spring-loaded for floor exercise. It has springs built into it underneath the flat surface. CHAPTER 3\n\nRoutine Matters\n\nGymnasts who want to compete in floor exercise string their tumbling\n\nmoves together into a routine. They perform for judges in a square area that\n\nis 40 feet (12 meters) long by 40 feet (12 m) wide. The boundaries are\n\nmarked by tape or chalk. If one foot or hand lands outside the boundaries\n\nduring a move, 0.10 is deducted from the average score. A female gymnast’s routine includes handstands, handsprings,\n\ncartwheels, round-offs, flips, leaps, jumps, and saltos. Dance moves must\n\nalso be incorporated in the routine. The performance is set to music and lasts up to 90 seconds. Male gymnasts focus on showing their strength and power. They plan a\n\nperformance that includes most of the same elements, but it is not set to\n\nmusic and does not include dance moves. Their routine lasts up to 70\n\nseconds. If you want to compete, your coach can be a big help. He or she can\n\nhelp you choreograph a routine. It should showcase your strongest\n\ntumbling moves as well as your personal style. Judging Gymnastics The judges at the Olympics look at specific components in floor routines. These things are:\n\nchoreography—how the moves are arranged to music\n\nartistry—variety of movements and creativity in the routine\n\nexpressiveness—how movements and facial gestures bring emotion into the performance\n\nmusicality—rhythm in the routine that matches the music\n\ntechnique—skill in executing moves\n\nMoves and Music\n\nOnly female gymnasts get to take on the challenge—and fun—of setting\n\ntheir tumbling moves to music. The first step is selecting a song."
    ],
    [
        "You can narrow your options by considering songs that are meaningful to you. Aly\n\nRaisman performed with the song Hava Nagila at the 2012 Olympics. Hava Nagila is a traditional Israeli folk song, which identified with the Jewish-\n\nAmerican gymnast. Raisman won a gold medal with the routine. Songs for floor routines must be between 30 and 90 seconds long. They\n\ncan’t include any lyrics. Judges will deduct points for songs with words. When planning choreography, match moves to the sounds and pacing in\n\nthe music. Make sure to use the entire area allowed. Perform your best\n\nskills at the end of the routine and when you are nearest to the judges. Fast Fact: Female gymnasts originally performed floor routines to live piano music. CHAPTER 4\n\nCompetition Time\n\nYoung gymnasts can compete in floor exercise in the Junior Olympics. There are 10 levels of competition. The lower levels are for beginners. The\n\nhigher levels are for more advanced gymnasts. Levels 9 and 10 are for elite\n\ngymnasts who compete in national competitions. The Junior Olympics uses a 10-point scoring system. Gymnasts are\n\nscored on the difficulty of their routine, the structure of the routine, and the\n\nexecution of moves. Gymnasts who reach the elite level in the sport may try to qualify for the\n\nOlympic Games. Gymnasts used to be able to earn a perfect 10 at the\n\nOlympics. The scoring system changed in 2005. Today, Olympic gymnasts\n\nare scored on two scales—difficulty and execution. Points for difficulty are\n\nearned depending on the difficulty of elements in a routine. Another set of\n\npoints is deducted for each mistake made in the element’s execution. The\n\ntwo scores are added together to become a gymnast’s final score. Fast Fact: The official rule book for elite competitions is called the Code of Points. The Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG) updates it every four years. Stick It Judges require gymnasts to land from tumbling passes without moving their feet. It’s called sticking a landing. This skill requires gymnasts to absorb landing forces when they hit the mat. Practice helps gymnasts learn the proper form to stick their landings. The skill is about more than impressing judges. Landing correctly from tumbling passes helps prevent injury. Strike Down Stress\n\nPractice helps gymnasts prepare to compete. Even so, it’s normal to feel\n\nsome jitters beforehand. Gymnasts take care of their bodies to help beat performance anxiety. It’s important for gymnasts to get enough sleep. Sleep deprivation can\n\ncause stress even for people who aren’t getting ready to compete. Teen gymnasts need between eight and a half and nine and a half hours of sleep\n\nper night. Fast Fact: Stress causes physical changes in the body including quicker breathing and tense muscles. Eating right is important too. Gymnasts need a diet high in\n\ncarbohydrates, moderate in protein, and low in fats. Poor nutrition can\n\nlead to poor performance, which can lead to feelings of stress. Mental health is just as important as physical health. Many gymnasts\n\nuse visualization techniques to prepare during training and before a meet. They imagine themselves performing their routine and picture each move in detail. Throughout the exercise, they see themselves performing perfectly. This type of visualization builds confidence so that they can perform well\n\nduring competition. Pack it Up\n\nImagine arriving at your competition and realizing you left some important items back home."

    [
        "You don’t have a water bottle or a hair tie. Now imagine getting there with everything you need in your gym bag. That’s much more relaxing, right? Preparing ahead of time is a great way to\n\nreduce stress on the day you compete. Make sure to bring water and a healthy snack. Pack wrist guards or tape\n\nif you need them. Bring bands and bobby pins to secure long hair away\n\nfrom your face and deodorant to apply before and after your events. You’ll\n\nalso need to bring a jacket and gym pants. They keep your muscles warm while you are waiting to perform. Don’t leave packing your bag until the last minute. Get ready the night\n\nbefore, and you’ll avoid rushing around in a panic on the day of your\n\ncompetition. Fast Fact: Gymnasts are required to pull their hair back tightly for safety reasons. They need to make sure hair won’t block their vision while doing their moves. CHAPTER 5\n\nLegends of Floor Exercise\n\nMany of the world’s most impressive gymnasts are drawn to compete in\n\nthe floor exercise event. Some of these gymnasts have become legends in\n\nthe event. Ecaterina Szabo\n\nEcaterina Szabo started doing gymnastics when she was about 5 years\n\nold. At age 6, she started training professionally. In 1984 Ecaterina won several Olympic medals for Romania, including\n\na gold in women’s floor exercise. Ecaterina retired from gymnastics in\n\n1988. She moved to France. In 2000 she was inducted into the International\n\nGymnastics Hall of Fame. A kindergarten and a sports arena in Romania\n\nwere named after her to honor her achievements. Alexandra ‘Aly’ Raisman\n\nAlexandra Raisman started gymnastics as a toddler. As she grew up, she\n\ntook the sport seriously. In her senior year of high school, she spent seven hours a day at the gym. Her workouts included climbing ropes without\n\nusing her legs while wearing 10-pound (4.5-kilograms) weights. Aly earned a spot on the U.S. Olympic women’s team when she was 18 years old. She was made team captain. At the 2012 Games, she won a gold\n\nmedal in the women’s floor exercise event. She became the first U.S. gymnast ever to do so. Viktor Chukarin\n\nViktor Chukarin’s path to greatness in gymnastics was not an easy one. His athletic career took a detour during World War II (1939-1945). He was\n\na soldier for the Soviet Union and a prisoner of war for four years before he could return to gymnastics. When Viktor returned to his sport, he trained to compete in the Olympic\n\nGames. He competed in the 1952 Games at age 30. He competed again at the 1956 Games. He won several medals at the Games, including a silver in\n\nfloor exercise in 1956. His career span as an athlete, as well as his medal count, makes him a legendary gymnast. Sawao Kato\n\nSawao Kato did not show natural talent as an athlete when he was a child. But he was a hard-working student. When he developed an interest in\n\ngymnastics, he worked hard at that too. He started winning competitions\n\nand eventually began training with Japan’s best gymnastics trainer, Akitomo Kaneko. Sawao won medals at the 1968 Olympic Games, including a gold in\n\nmen’s floor exercise. He went on to win more medals at the 1972 and 1976 Games for a career total of 12. He is one of the most successful Japanese\n\nOlympians, and was inducted into the International Gymnastics Hall of\n\nFame in 2001. Whether practicing or competing, gymnasts who train in tumbling skills\n\nalways benefit as athletes."

Each volume examines the history of the sport and the rules of play; it also acts as a guide for prevention and treatment of injuries, and includes instruction on stretching, warming up, and strength training, all of which can help play- ers avoid the most common musculoskeletal injuries. Each volume also includes tips on healthy nutrition for athletes, as well as information on the risks of using performance-enhancing drugs or other illegal substances. GettinG the edGe offers ways for readers to healthily and legally improve their performance and gain more enjoyment from playing sports. Young athletes will find these volumes informative and helpful in their pursuit of excellence. Sports medicine professionals assigned to a sport with which they are not familiar can also benefit from this series. For example, a football ath- letic trainer may need to provide medical care for a local gymnastics meet. Although the emergency medical principles and action plan would remain the same, the athletic trainer could provide better care for the gymnasts after reading a simple overview of the principles of gymnastics in GettinG the edGe. Although these books offer an overview, they are not intended to be comprehensive in the recognition and management of sports injuries. They should not replace the professional advice of a trainer, doctor, or nutrition- ist. The text helps the reader appreciate and gain awareness of the sport’s history, standard training techniques, common injuries, dietary guidelines,\n\nIntroduction 7\n\nand the dangers of using drugs to gain an advantage. Reference material and directed readings are provided for those who want to delve further into these subjects. Written in a direct and easily accessible style, GettinG the edGe is an enjoyable series that will help young people learn about sports and sports medicine. —Susan Saliba, Ph.D., National Athletic Trainers’ Association Education Council\n\nUnderstanding the Words Things that are synchronized take place at the same time. Acrobatic has to do with performances that emphasize balance and coordination. Eligibility has to do with being qualified for a task. Criteria are factors used to judge a contest (for instance, a gymnastic performance). An apparatus is a piece of equipment used to perform a task. In this book, apparatus refers to parts of the gym like parallel bars or suspended rings. Elite means that something is intended for only the top few. 10 GYMNASTICS\n\nGymnastics is a sport involving exercises that require physical strength, flex- ibility, agility, balance, and coordination. There are different activities within gymnastics, from group activities to individual ones. The exercises also con- centrate on different skills, ranging from leaping to keeping good rhythm. Ancient History Gymnastic sports have been around as long as or longer than any other athletic activity. They origi- nated in ancient Greece; the philosopher Plato mentions gymnastics in his classic the Repub- lic, where he stated that “gymnastics [should] be preserved in their original form and no innovation made.” Athletes have not listened to his advice! Gym- nastics were performed quite differently in ancient Greece than they are performed currently. For example, ancient Greeks con- sidered wrestling, running, and boxing to be a part of gymnastics; today we think of these as separate sports. DID YOU KNOW? The first Olympics took place in 776 b.c.e., in Olympia, Greece. Run- ning, however, was the only sport included. In the second century b.C.e., the Roman Empire took over Greece— and with this change in government, came major cultural shifts as well. Gym- nastics changed form, losing the Greek emphasis on self-improvement, and turned into violent gladiator fights. In 393 c.e., a series of financial scandals and the rise of Christianity, which did not encourage a focus on the body’s abilities, ended gymnas-\n\ntics until the modern era. Overview of Gymnastics 11\n\nNineteenth-Century Re- birth Friedrich Ludwig Jahn and Per Hernrik Ling made gymnastics popular again in the nineteenth century. During the early 1800s, physical com- petition was popular in Europe, especially in the armed forces. Jahn, a German schoolteacher, invented the exercises and equipment that are used in modern gymnastics, including the paral- lel bars, vaulting horse, rings, and the horizontal bar. He organized associations called turneveins for the practice of gymnastics. German emigrants exported these organiza- tions to the United States, and the turneveins became the foundation of modern gymnastic associations. While Friedrich Jahn devel- oped gymnastics based on equipment; Ling developed routines based on fluid and\n\nDID YOU KNOW? The ancient Greeks performed gymnastics naked. The word for “gymnastics” comes from two separate roots: the Greek words for “naked” and “fond of athletic exercise.”\n\nFriedrich Ludwig Jahn is known as “Turnvater” or “Turnpater” Jahn, which roughly translates to “the father of gymnastics.”\n\n12 GYMNASTICS\n\nexpressive body movement without equipment. These were also known as rhythmic gymnastics. Across nineteenth-century Europe, gymnas- tics became popular in schools and sports clubs. In the United States, gymnastics were estab- lished in the 1830s, and the first official gymnas- tic club was founded in 1850. During this era, the Federation Internationale Gymnastique (FIG) offi- cially controlled and regulated world gymnastics. Meanwhile, in the United Kingdom, the British Ama- teur Gymnastics Association (AGA) formed in 1888, in the United States, the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) regulated gymnastics after 1883. DID YOU KNOW? Ancient Greek gymnasts were as concerned with developing the mind in gymnastics as the body. In fact, philosophers would meet at gymnasi- ums along with athletes. In 1896, the Olympic games included gymnastics for the first time. That year, the summer Olympics were appropriately held in Athens, the place where gymnastics began. Athletes performed on the vault, pommel horse, the rings, the parallel bars, and the high bar. By 1924, Olympic gymnasts competed for individual titles in each category as well as groups. Olympic officials first included women gymnasts in 1924 but only for some team titles. Not until 1952 were women allowed to compete in an equal number of cat- egories as male gymnasts. Modern Gymnastics Modern gymnastics are separated into two main categories: classic gymnas- tics and rhythmic gymnastics. Classic gymnasts use the traditional equipment developed by Friedrich Jahn. For men, this includes parallel bars, high bar (sometimes called the\n\nThe parallel bars, shown here, are adjustable so the height of the bars above the floor and distance between the bars can be set for each gymnast. Overview of Gymnastics 13\n\n14 GYMNASTICS\n\nGymnastic Events\n\nHere is a brief overview of the major gymnastic events:\n\nFloor exercises: A gymnast performs frontward or back- ward acrobatic movements. There are also non-acrobatic features to a performance, such as balancing moves or jumps. Both male and female gymnasts perform floor routines. Pommel horse: This is one of the hardest gymnastic\n\nevents in which to compete. A player moves in circular motion on a raised bar; only his hands may touch the bar. The pommel horse is a men’s event. Rings: A gymnast uses two suspended rings, swinging and flipping into positions in which he will freeze for a moment. Difficulty of the positions is a deciding factor. This is a men’s event. horizontal bar), rings, pommel horse, and the vault. Floor exercises are also used. Women compete with floor exercise, uneven bars (sometimes called asymmetric bars), beam, and vaults. In rhythmic gymnastics, dancelike athletic routines are performed on a mat, using handheld equipment such as ribbons, balls, and hoops. The equipment helps the athlete demonstrate graceful fluid movements. Both individuals and teams compete in rhythmic gymnastics. Teams demonstrate synchronized\n\nOverview of Gymnastics 15\n\nVault: Gymnasts sprint down a runway onto a spring-\n\nboard and do flips and twists in the air before landing. Both male and female gymnasts perform the vault, although the styles are slightly different for men and women. Beam: A female gymnast performs a series of flips,\n\nturns, and somersaults on a 16 foot long balance beam, before dismounting. Parallel bars: Male gymnasts do many swings on two\n\nparallel bars. There are specific guidelines to how often they can stop and the different kind of swings required. High bar: A male gymnast does many flips and jumps\n\nwhile swinging on a single suspended bar before dismounting. Uneven bars: A women’s gymnastic event in which\n\ngymnasts do flips and swing from one bar to the other several times before dismounting. patterns when faced against one another."

        "Rhythmic gymnastics started in the 1930s. The FIG accepted them in 1962, and in 1984, officials for the Olympic games also accepted them. Gymnastic Careers Gymnastics requires dedication in training and self-confidence when performing. Athletes who compete in gymnastics dedicate large por-\n\n16 GYMNASTICS\n\ntions of their life to the game. This becomes more and more levels of competition. Families have been known to move miles to get to a good coach, and young gym- nasts can spend more hours practicing per week than many adults do in full-time jobs. For athletes to transform themselves from beginners to Olympic gold medalists, they must dedicate their lives to gymnastics. Few can achieve the privilege of competing on an international level, but many rewards can be achieved even if an athlete never makes it to the\n\ntrue at higher\n\nThe two bars on the uneven bar apparatus are 4.3 ft (130cm) to 5.9 ft (180 cm) apart, depending on each gymnast’s individual adjustment.

        "Women’s gymnastics get more coverage and attention than men’s. This is different than most team sports, espe- cially basketball. There are a few other sports in which the sexes get equal attention (like ten- nis), but gymnastics is one of the few in which women’s participation is more emphasized. Overview of Gymnastics 17\n\nDID YOU KNOW? Female gymnasts reach their athletic peak much sooner than male gymnasts. Female gymnasts are at their best between ages 14 to 18. Male gymnasts, on the other hand, achieve peak performance in their late teens to early twenties. In 1996, the Olympics raised the minimum age for young women to perform gymnastics from fifteen to sixteen. While this doesn’t seem like a dramatic change, many coaches were upset because age fifteen may be when female gymnasts are at their peak. Artistic elements are an important part of the overall score\n\nin some of the gymnastic events. This jump is known as a “stag ring leap,” and it combines athletic ability with dance-like movement. 18 GYMNASTICS\n\nDID YOU KNOW?"

Junior Olympic Program The first step in the journey to becoming a national representative is getting into the Junior Olympic Program (J.O.P.) There are ten levels for girls and seven for boys. Age and ability determine the levels for boys, while ability\n\nOverview of Gymnastics 19\n\nalone determines the level for young women. Gymnasts go up the levels by increasing the quality of technique in their special field. To pass the first levels, gymnasts perform techniques required by the governing body of gymnastics in the United States. In these performances, they must grade high enough to advance to the next level. At the higher levels of eligibility, the athlete can choose the technique in which he performs. The criteria to judge each level of the J.O.P. are difficult. Any error in style or technique results in points deducted from an athlete’s final score. In the men’s Class 5 level of the J.O.P., gymnasts are required to achieve a score\n\nDID YOU KNOW? Most gymnasts start performing at a young age, sometimes as early as two years old. The earlier an athlete performs, the better her chances of advancing to the highest levels of competition. 20 GYMNASTICS\n\nof at least 9.3 out of 10.0. The routines for men’s Class 5 are: floor exercises, pommel horse, rings, vault, parallel bars, and the high bar. According to the rules:\n\nIf the skills of each sequence are performed with improper technique or if this gymnast falls on or off the apparatus, has a lapse in form, or any other errors, deductions are taken. Gymnasts make up for lost points through a “virtuosity bonus,” additional points awarded for flawlessly executing a technique. Even if it is possible to achieve a higher class in the J.O.P., it may not be the best option. When starting a new class, a gymnast may feel overwhelmed. By going into a new class too early, she may start at the bottom when she was previously very competitive at a lower level. Choosing to stay at a lower level a little longer may not be unwise. Getting a 10.0: The Scoring System The basic scoring is based on how many errors a competitor makes. Single deductions range from: • 0.1 (small error) • 0.2 (medium error) • 0.3 (large error) • 0.5 (fall or an added part) • 1.0 (missing part)\n\nOverview of Gymnastics 21\n\nPommel horse routines require a lot of upper body strength, which is why they are only done by male gymnasts. Elite Program If a gymnast passes through the J.O.P., he is able to enter the Elite Program, also known as the International Program. This is the most intensive program, with training conducted under the eyes of the U.S.A. Gymnastics Training Team; many gymnasts train up to thirty-six hours a week. The training team picks individuals who will represent the United States in major competition. Participants in the Elite Program are eligible to compete in U.S. National Championships and in international competitions, including the Olympics and World Championships. 22 GYMNASTICS\n\nDisagreements in Scoring\n\nSometimes there are disagreements among specialists between what is a fair judging call. In the 1992 Olympics, Tatiana Gutsu beat Shannon Miller by .012, which was the smallest margin of victory ever. Her win was very controver- sial for a number of reasons. While Miller had a relatively error-free competition, Gutsu stumbled forward in the opening of her floor routine. Adding to the outrage, Gutsu didn’t qualify for the all-around competition, but her coaches pushed her into the team that was playing because they saw potential for Olympic gold from her. At another competition, where Paul Hamm was the first American to win gold, the bronze medalist, Yang Tae-Young, claimed a judging error on his parallel bar routine docked him one-tenth of a point unfairly. The International Gymnas- tics Federation (FIG) agreed with Young, but because the score wasn’t disputed immediately after being announced, Paul Hamm kept the trophy. With competitions so close, the scoring and rules are up to the judges. Overview of Gymnastics 23\n\nYoung gymnasts who show exceptional talent can go through fast track courses such as the “Future Stars” and “Talent Opportunity Program,” which consist of training and competitive events at the highest standards. Only gymnasts who meet the exacting demands of the programs are able to get into them. The Elite Program has many detailed evaluations that assess the gymnast’s talent, and its leaders choose individuals to compete in the U.S. National Championships. Olympic Glory After the National Championships, the National Team chooses competitors for international teams. Most of those chosen are ranked winners, but not all are. Once selected, however, a gymnast does not have a guaranteed entry into the Olympics. The National Team requires an enormous amount of train- ing, and once on the team, the athlete must continually prove her right to remain there. Keep It Fun The more you enjoy gymnastics the better you will be at it. Training isn’t always fun and competition can be stressful, but make sure to enjoy the sport. Steve Whitlock, Director of Internet Services at USA Gymnastics, says: “the main reason why young people drop out of gymnastics is that their sport stops being fun.”\n\n24 GYMNASTICS\n\nGeorge Eyser Born in 1871 in Kiel, Germany, Eyser moved to Denver, Colorado, at the age of fourteen. He lost his leg after being stuck by a train, but this did not stop him from being a fierce competitor in gymnastics. He became a U.S. citizen in 1894, and in October 1904, he performed in the Olympics, winning three gold medals for the United States in one day, as well as winning two silver medals and one bronze medal. This achievement is even more incredible when you consider that disabled players com- peted as equals with nondisabled players! Overview of Gymnastics 25\n\nShannon Miller Shannon Miller has won more medals than any other gym- nast in America. She was born in Oklahoma and began training at the age of five. At age nine, her family moved her to Russia for a time to train. There, Shannon impressed the Soviet trainers, who believed she had the natural potential to be a world-class gymnast. By 1991, at the Arthur Gandor competition, she achieved an all-around score of 39.875, the highest total amount of points ever recorded by an Ameri- can woman within a traditional scale. She continued to win medals, eventually gaining seven Olympic gold medals and nine World Championship medals. This makes her the most decorated American gymnast, male or female, in the history of the sport. She is also the only woman—for any sport—to be inducted into the United States Olympic Hall of Fame twice. Her competitive spirit is what always kept her going. She once said, “I compete with myself”—which for the best gym- nasts, is the toughest, most rigorous competition of all. Understanding the Words If someone or something is professional, that person or thing follows the rules of behavior that apply to someone who makes her living in a particular field. A gym that is professional takes safety and sportsmanship as seriously as if each athlete training there were going on to earn his living at gymnastics. Visualization is the act of making a mental picture of something. 28 GYMNASTICS\n\nMental preparation is crucial to success in gymnastics. If an athlete is dis- tracted or tired, she won’t be able to perform to the best of her ability. There is little to no room for error in gymnastics, so being mentally prepared before a competition is important. Lynn Jennings, an Olympic gold medalist in run- ning, stated, “Mental will is a muscle that needs exercise, just like muscles of the body.”\n\nFinding a Gym To be fully prepared, you need to find the right coach. Look for these qualities in the coach’s gym:\n\na friendly, professional atmosphere between staff and trainees\n\nwell-kept equipment that meets the highest standards\n\ntrainers that have a safety certification from the U.S.A. gymnastics. coaches that keep their athletes busy with events, competitions, and\n\nsocial activities. Mental Training The purpose of mental training is to control your inner voice, that little part of you that whispers all your worries, self-criticism, and doubts. Gymnastics take concentration and determination, and that negative inner voice can dis- tract you. The more you can control your thoughts while you’re performing, the better your chances are of excelling in gymnastics. Try your best to control negative thoughts and push them into a positive, constructive direction. Say positive statements to yourself like, “Each day I am getting better at the high bar,” even when you don’t feel your best. Fake it till you make it! By repeating these statements, you encourage both your mind and your body to perform at their best. If a negative thought arises,\n\nMental Preparation & Safety 29\n\nTo be a successful gymnast, preparing your mind is as important as preparing your body. 30 GYMNASTICS\n\nMental Focus During Competition Follow these guidelines before and during a competition to keep up your mental focus:\n\nMake sure every item of equipment has been packed. If you forget something you need, it increases anxiety and lowers confidence. Arrive at the competition on time; being late causes\n\nworry you don’t need. Warm up in the competition hall if you can. By getting\n\nused to the environment (the noise of the crowd, lighting, etc.), you can get an advantage in competition. Visualize your performance before you start competing. Picture yourself with grace and confidence. Make sure to eat something small and high in carbo- hydrates before and after a competition. Food is your body’s fuel. Keep it fun, even during a competition. Judges react well to a positive attitude—and keeping your feelings light during a competition helps release stress. By acting like a competition isn’t the most important event in the his- tory of the universe, you will improve your performance. Mental Preparation & Safety 31\n\ncontinue to repeat a positive statement to counteract it. Continue to do this until positive thinking becomes a habit. If an area in your life drags you down and depresses you, speak to a coach or trainer about this problem. Chances are, if a problem affects all other areas in your life, the problem will affect your performance at the gymnasium as well. Try to solve any pressing life problems with the same energy you apply to your athletics. Memorization By improving your memory, you can also improve your concentration and focus. Here’s an exercise that will help you. Lay five playing cards face up and memorize the cards one at a time. Flip the cards over and take a break for five minutes. After the break, try your best to remember what is on each card. If you do well at this, then increase the number of cards. This task may seem to have nothing to do with gymnastics, but it will sharpen your focus and increase your concentration. Breathing Exercises By closing your eyes, you can focus your mind on your breathing. Pull air in and out of your nose and exhale out of your mouth. Be as mindful of your breathing as possible. If your mind wanders away from your breathing, bring your attention back to the sound and sensation of your lungs filling with air. Only thinking about one thing is difficult because of the way we live; we tend to multitask, with our minds racing between several things at a time. If this mental exercise is especially hard for you, don’t be self-critical; simply try your best to relax and slow down your mind. These exercises need to be repeated; as with anything in life, the more you practice, the better you will get. Doing these exercise will help you be able to strengthen your concentra- tion while performing. 32 GYMNASTICS\n\nVisualization If you are learning a difficult maneuver, visualization may help reduce anxiety and improve performance. While sitting in a quiet, comfortable place, imagine performing the tasks that you are most worried about."

    [
        "Imagine all the actions that you will perform; be as detailed as possible."
    ],
    [
        "Picture yourself performing these actions perfectly. Think of the sound of the crowd, the silence before you start, the feeling in your muscles while you perform, the scores you will get, and the smile on your coach’s face when you get that much-deserved 10.0. Research shows that when the mind imagines a scene in detail, the body learns the action as though it were actually doing it. While visualization cannot replace physical training, it will help your body remember techniques and improve your confidence. The more often you visualize the movements, the more your mind will help your body in learning a difficult task. Goals Before you train, set realistic but ambitious goals. Try and make the goals as specific as possible. All athletes have dreams of glory in their minds; the best have goals written on paper. Benefits for Life Gymnastics also has benefits outside of the gymnasium. Shannon Miller stated, “Gymnastics has helped me so much; it’s taught me how to be dedicated to something, how to work hard, how to achieve my goals, also to be organized and how to try to balance my life out. I think it has helped me in school, too, because it has kept me organized and I’m always striving for a goal.”\n\nAn example of a vague goal would be: “Make my coach proud.” Instead, set a goal for yourself you can mea- sure, such as: “Get a bronze medal,” “Score above an 8.0 at my next competition,” or “Get accepted into a higher-class level by the next season.” By creating measurable goals, you will increase the mental payoff from an achievement. Be realistic, though; ask your coach whether or not your goal is possible. Challenge yourself, but make sure your dream can be achieved."

Much of competition is mental; if you walk into a performance thinking you can win a perfect score, you heighten your chances of making the score. Reading Read as much as you can about gymnastics. Get books on everything from biographies of great gymnasts to instructional guides. By learning about your sport, you build enthusiasm for what you are doing. Treat gymnastics as much as a mental challenge as a physical one. By overcoming mental challenges, we are better equipped to control our bodies. Safety Maintaining gym equipment most likely won’t be your responsibility if you train at a professional gym. Your coach should make sure that the equipment is\n\nAdvice for Parents The support of parents is crucial. To go for a career in gym- nastics at the highest levels, young athletes give up large parts of their childhoods to follow their dreams. Worries about failure and high expectations are normal. Parents need to support their child athletes and let them know that no mat- ter how much they succeed or fail, they will still be loved the same. If the young athlete knows she has her parents’ sup- port no matter what, chances are she will perform better. Mental Preparation & Safety 35\n\nEducation and Gymnastics The ancient Greek philosopher Plato stated thousands of years go that gymnastics was the best education: “Let us describe the education of men. What then is the education to be? Perhaps we could hardly find a better experience of the past that expresses the body than gymnastics. I believe in gymnastic for the body and music for the mind.”\n\nset up properly and that equipment works at its best. There are a few things, however, to keep in mind when exercising:\n\nMake sure floor mats are fastened tightly to the ground. Any gap\n\nbetween mats could cause injury. Check the spacing between pieces of equipment. If they are too close\n\ntogether, other athletes might collide with each other. Velcro® should be clean of lint. Remove lint with a stiff brush. Worn-out and damaged equipment should be taken care of properly."
    ],
    [
        "If you have any worry that a piece of equipment isn’t safe, don’t use it. Understanding the Words Tendons are the stretchy bands that hold muscles and bones together. Ligaments are the strong tissues that hold bones together. Your hamstring is the muscle at the back of your thigh—or the tendons at the back of your knee are also known as your hamstring. Efficiency has to do with something’s effectiveness or ability to achieve a purpose. 38 GYMNASTICS\n\nWarming up before exercising is crucial. Cold muscles are injured much more easily than warm muscles. Without proper stretches, muscles, tendons, and ligaments have a greater risk of tearing or straining when under stress. A proper warm-up consists of light exercise to raise body temperature, followed by stretching. Light Exercise The goal of a warm-up is to raise the body temperature and loosen muscles. Light, gentle exercises are best; these preparatory exercises should not put the body under much strain. A gymnast needs to perform warm-ups specific to her sport to prevent injuries. Falls or impacts with equipment are the most common accidents that occur, resulting in acute sprains in the ankles and wrists. Wrists To warm up the wrists, shake them lightly and then circle the hands while keeping the forearms still."

    [
        "Circle in one direction for about twenty seconds and then reverse direction. Then, bend the hands backward and forward; change direction once every second for twenty seconds. Know Your Limits The exercises given in this chapter are merely guidelines. Modify the exercises to what suits you best. If you don’t feel prepared once you are done with them, then repeat, and next time add more repetitions. The point of these exercises is to warm up your muscles. Physical Preparation 39\n\nAnkles To warm up the ankles, put one hand against a wall and lift one leg from the floor. Circle the foot around, then alternate directions and feet. At the end, push and pull each ankle backward and forward. Repeat both movements about ten times. Stretching Stretching increases the body’s ability to move by lengthening muscles. This is important because a gymnast needs to be able to move his body flex- ibly without risk of injury. For example, when a gymnast performs jumping splits, all the muscle groups and ligaments of the legs and hips are stretched to the fullest. If a gymnast is not flexible, the strain from this exercise may tear muscles or\n\nWarming up your muscles is important before any physical activity, especially one like gymnastics that requires so much flexibility. 40 GYMNASTICS\n\nother tissues. Stretching reduces the possibility of sprain and helps sore muscles recover from previous workouts. Trainers use hundreds of different stretches. Here are a few that apply most to a young gymnast. DID YOU KNOW? Ballistic stretches are performed with bouncing or jerking movements. Most train- ers today discourage this technique because sudden movements can result in damaged muscles or ligaments. These stretches also do not build flexibility in a safe or gradual manner. RESISTANCE STRETCHING Resistance stretching is based on the idea that a relaxed muscle stretches better than a tense muscle. Suddenly relaxing tense muscles allows for a more efficient stretch. Resistance stretch- ing is an effective technique, but be careful not to stretch further than you should and tear or pull muscles. Be mindful of your limits when performing these techniques. The “Contract-Relax” (CR) technique is the most common way to perform resistance stretches. These exercises are most often done with a partner. To stretch the hamstring muscles, the athlete lies on her back and places a leg on the shoulder of a partner who kneels in a supporting position. She contracts her hamstring muscles lightly, and pushes against the shoulder, holding for up to fifteen seconds. Then when she relaxes the muscles, her partner pushes his legs gently toward her face. This process should repeat, each time stretching the leg further and further. STATIONARy STRETCHING Stationary stretching is the most common type of stretch. It involves stretch- ing to the point of tension and holding the position for up to ten seconds. While the muscle is stretched, it will relax and lengthen. The side split is an example of a typical stationary stretch. The athlete lowers his torso toward the ground, supporting his body weight on his hands\n\nPhysical Preparation 41\n\nand opening his legs to an “A” shape. When he senses he has reached the limit of his stretch, he stops and relaxes the leg muscles for ten seconds. The athlete should then push the stretch further, holding the stretch in place for longer before gently pulling out of the position when done. RULES FOR SAFE STRETCHING • If you feel any sud-\n\nden pain or burning sensations, stop immediately. Stop if you feel nau- seated, faint, or ill. Muscles need a\n\ngood supply of oxy- gen while stretching, so make an effort to breathe deeply and frequently. Stretch after a work- out. Tired and sore muscles recover more quickly if stretched while the body cools down. Stretching after also prevents the body from over-tightening and stiffening. When stretching, movements should be slow—each stretching pose should be held long enough to allow the tense muscles time to relax and lengthen. 42 GYMNASTICS\n\nWHEN NOT TO STRETCH Do not performing stretches if:\n\nYou have a muscle injury. You are recovering from a bone fracture, unless stretching is a part of\n\nyour physical therapy. After you stretch you find yourself less flex-\n\nible; this could indicate a problem such as a disease or illness. Your joint is unstable from an injury. You feel intense pain when trying to stretch. DID YOU KNOW? Gymnasts use chalk to absorb sweat from the hands. Chalk gives the hands better grip on the rings, bars, and pommel horse. Any major gym will have chalk available. Always use chalk before mounting equipment. Physical Preparation 43\n\nSafe Training To be physically prepared, a gymnast should closely follow her coach’s advice. Here are a few safety guidelines for training:\n\nA spotter should be present while you work out. The spot- ter’s job is to watch and guide during techniques. Some- times he helps by physically guiding you. Other times he will help you train by giving verbal advice. Use any safety apparatus while learning potentially danger-\n\nous techniques. While learning the vault or any other exercise that involves heavy landing, use a deep foam pad that catches your fall. You can go from softer to harder surfaces until you are ready to compete. Training Techniques\n\nPLANCHE STRENGTH The planche is a position where the athlete holds her body par- allel to the ground by using only her hands. The position some- times looks as thought the athlete is floating. The gymnasts who have the most planche strength usually have an advan- tage over other gymnasts who don’t. Bench presses are one of the best exercises used to achieve planche strength. Do at least three sets of eight repetitions,\n\nDuring training, gymnasts need to build strength to allow them to do difficult routines safely. Doing handstands or planche strength exercises will help build the necessary upper body and arm strength. 44 GYMNASTICS\n\ndoing as many as possible while still being able to do the required number of repetitions comfortably. Never go beyond what you feel comfortable doing. Dumbbell raises are also a good way to achieve strength. Raise dumbbells in each hand over your head, and then lower them slowly. Repeat eight times, doing three sets. While doing this exercise, be mindful of how straight your back is. When you do a workout, you want to isolate the muscle being used as much as possible. Strength in your lower stomach is also important. You can work those muscles on the high bar that is used during competitions. By hanging with your wrists facing forward, bring your legs up straight. Do three sets of thirty repetitions. If this becomes easy, then you can use ankle weights. FLExIBILITy ExERCISES Acrobatic exercises and dynamic movements are needed in most gymnastic exercises, so stretching is crucial. The hamstring stretch, squats, and arm rotator stretch are the major stretches needed. For the hamstring stretch, stand with a foot raised on a table. Keeping the leg bent, lean your chest toward your bent knee. You should feel your hamstring muscles tensing up. Continue and release, doing this as many time as it takes for your hamstrings to feel looser. To perform a leg squat, stand with your feet apart. With one leg pointed forward, squat down to that leg far enough so that you can put a hand on the ground. For an arm-up rotator stretch, you need to stand straight with arms out. Place your forearm straight upward, placing a broomstick in your hand and below your elbow; using the broom, lightly rotate the arm muscles by making rotating motions toward the wall behind you. (You don’t have to necessarily use a broom; you could also use a towel or resistance band.)\n\nPhysical Preparation 45\n\nPractice Safety During Practice The majority of sports injuries do not occur during perfor- mances or competitions. Sixty percent of all sports-related injuries occur during practice. In a study in 1998, researchers found that more than 25,000 children and adolescents ages 5 to 14 went to hospital emer- gency rooms because of a gymnastics-related injury. Girls are especially vulnerable to injuries because of the amount of competition involved at a young age. Gymnastics injuries are common in children and adolescents. In fact, among girls’ sports, gymnastics has one of the highest injury rates for girls ages 5 to 14. 46 GYMNASTICS\n\nWEIGHT TRAINING Some gymnasts do weight training like push-ups or bench-presses to increase upper-arm strength. The exercises used in gymnastics vary widely;\n\nA successful training program has to include a lot of practice on the individual pieces of equipment. A gymnast has to memorize his routine and get his body used to all the moves before he will be prepared for competition. Physical Preparation 47\n\nDangers of Plyometrics\n\nYoung teens should beware of overdoing plyometrics. Because their muscles are still developing, injuries are a greater danger for younger athletes. Heavy plyometrics should not be practiced until an athlete is at least sixteen years old—and even then, also work with a coach to make sure you perform plyometrics correctly. Bad form can create overuse injuries that are discussed in the next chapter. for instance, a woman performing graceful gymnastic movements won’t need the same upper-body strength that a male gymnast does who uses immense amounts of arm strength on the pommel horse or rings. To get increased arm strength, you can go to the weight room about three times a week to supplement your regular exercise schedule. As you go up in class rank you may need to go to the weight room more often, but at lower levels keep the gym exercises as your main source of exercise. PLyOMETRIC TRAINING Plyometric exercises are designed to increase muscle reaction time; they produce fast movements that produce a great amount of power. Plyometrics can also improve muscle efficiency. Think of these exercises as improving the delivery system for muscles, while other weight-training exercises improve the amount that can be delivered. For some acrobatic exercises, plyometric training is incredibly important. 48 GYMNASTICS\n\nThe speed and power of a gymnast’s muscles are put to the test more than in other sports. A good example is the vault, in which the athlete is judged by an incredibly rapid spurt of movements, which take place only in a matter of seconds. An athlete should be careful, however, not to do too many preparatory exercises involving plyometrics. By their nature, these exercises involve breaking down the body to train it to react faster the next time. It is best to perform these exercises before the body has suffered from fatigue. Space major plyometric exercises to an every-other-day basis. Plyometric techniques vary; we will only highlight the most useful ones for gymnastics. The broad jump, for example, improves muscle reaction time in the thighs, resulting in an ability to move the muscles in explosive spurts. Are You at Risk? If you fall under these categories you may want to place extra attention on safety precautions:\n\nperforming at an advanced level: If you are perform-\n\ning at a high level of competitive class, especially on a national or international level, you are more at risk of injury. doing your main exercises on the beam: Falls are\n\ncommon. practicing more than 20 hours a week: Athletes who\n\npractice this much need to be very mindful of overuse injuries (highlighted in the next chapter)\n\nPhysical Preparation 49\n\nUsing the Internet Like nearly every other topic, there is a great wealth of infor- mation about gymnastics on the Internet, with thousands of links to all aspects of the sport. Keep in mind that nothing can beat the advice of a personal trainer. While the Internet is a great source of information once you have a background in gymnastics, it can have misleading or sometimes false infor- mation. Beware of what you read and always consult with your trainer before trying a new exercise. Place your feet a shoulder’s length apart, then crouch down very low and extend your legs to do a jump. Jump by swinging your arms while bending your knees to increase distance. Measure the distance you covered and aim to improve it next time. The broad jump puts a larger amount of strain on your body than other exercises, so it is called a high-impact exercise. Simpler, lower-impact exercises can also improve muscle reaction time. An example is the ankle bounce: an athlete rapidly bounces on her feet with- out any pause."
    ],
    [
        "This exercise should isolate the muscles around the ankle, improving reaction time. Understanding the Words Inflammation is when body tissue reacts to injury or stress by becom- ing hot and swollen. A dislocation happens when a body part is pushed out of its normal position. Alignment means that things are lined up correctly. Immobilizes means to make something so that it cannot move. A regimen is a course of physical training. Mobility is the ability to move."

        "A diagnosis is an identification of the source of a physical problem. 52 GYMNASTICS\n\nThere are two types of injury common to gymnastics: injuries from falling or hitting an object, and slow wear-and-tear that finally results in an injured joint or limb. Both types happen equally as much. The most typical injuries that occur are sprains, muscle strains, bruises, and inflammation. Parts of the body that are easily damaged differ between men and women. Female athletes most frequently injure their feet, ankles, knees, hands, wrists, and elbows, while male gymnasts can also suffer these injuries, but their backs and shoulders are injured more often than women’s. The reason men suffer these injuries more is because the parallel bars, rings, and pommel horse all put emphasis on the back and shoulders; women don’t use these apparatus. Sprains When a joint twists in the wrong direction, a sprain occurs. The athlete will feel pain and tenderness in the effected area, and the joint can appear swollen and bruised. When sprained, the joint will not be able to move as well. The more often a sprain occurs, the more seri- ous the damage is to the ligament, and the worse the swelling will look. The pain from a sprained joint can last for years. The knees and wrists are the most common parts of the body to suffer from sprains. When a sprain occurs:\n\nDID YOU KNOW? If you’ve suffered from an injury, your chances of being injured again are much greater. A coach should carefully monitor a previously injured athlete. Stop using the joint. Rest the damaged joint in a position that is comfortable, supporting it\n\nwith a cushion. Common Injuries, Treatment, & Recovery 53\n\nUse a cold compress (a bag of ice or cold water) on the swollen joint. This will reduce further swelling. Wrap the joint in soft padding and bandage it in place. You could also use a compression bandage, which holds the injured area tightly. If an ankle is severely damaged, raise the leg on a chair to reduce\n\nblood flow and lessen swelling. These are treatments that need to be used immediately after the joint has been sprained. After these things have been done, the injured athlete may need medical treatment. Treatment will involve physical therapy and in some extreme cases, surgery. Bruising around the area of a sprain is very common. 54 GYMNASTICS\n\nDegrees of Pain When you are injured think about what kind of pain you are going through. Is it acute or chronic? Acute pain occurs with a sharp, sudden sensation that is located in one location in the body, while chronic pain occurs gradually and feels like a dull ache. For sprains, rest is usually the best medicine. If you know you have a sprain, refrain from any strenuous activity for a week or longer. The cold com- press should be applied a few times daily, but try not to apply it to your body for more than twenty minutes at a time, since localized frostbite may occur if it’s applied any longer. After a week of rest, begin to move the joint around, gently testing your joint’s range of move- ment (R.O.M.)."
    ],
    [
        "An example of testing your R.O.M. would be to slowly rotate a sprained ankle, revers- ing directions after a few light turns. The goal in doing an exercise like this is to make the joint flexible again. If any pain occurs, stop moving the joint and go back to earlier steps. After the joint can fully move in all directions, use lightweight exercises to strengthen it. A sprain can take from one week to two months to heal. Go back to training gradually, and stay mindful of the injured joint. If the sprain still hurts after six months, go back to your doctor. DID YOU KNOW?"
    ],
    [
        "Younger athletes are less likely to injure them- selves than older ones. Children do not have the strength in their muscle to cause the overuse injury or accidents that are common to older teens in gymnastics. As a teen gets older and grows muscle mass, he needs increased attention and education about sports injuries. Common Injuries, Treatment, & Recovery 55\n\nThe treatments highlighted here for sprains can also be used for pulled muscles, pulled ligaments, or bruising. Specialists call these “soft-tissue” inju- ries. Most injuries that cause swelling and bruising and amounts of pain that are not very severe can be treated in a similar manner: apply a cold com- press, rest, and if needed, raise the limb. Don’t self-diagnose a serious medical problem."

        "If at any time you feel an unusual amount of pain, consult a doctor or paramedic. Always let your coach know what you are going through. A coach should have experience with how to prevent and treat different kinds of injuries. Fractures and Dislocations When the force of impact on a bone is too much for it to handle, it breaks. A fracture occurs when a bone is broken into pieces or snaps due to high stress\n\nA broken bone may need to be held immobile through the use of a hard cast. This allows the bones to heal without risk of further injury. 56 GYMNASTICS\n\nfrom impact. When a knee or shoulder is pushed out of its normal position, a dislocation occurs. In gymnastics, fractures and dislocations are rarer than in sports that are higher impact. Gymnasts do, however, sometimes suffer these injuries. A fracture can occur in the legs and arms or wrist and fingers from a heavy fall from a piece of equipment or a bad landing from a vault jump. Dislocations usually occur in the knees from heavy falls or landings. The shoulders and fingers are dam- aged from accidents on the pommel horse, rings, or parallel bars. Fractures require direct medical attention. Good gyms have at least one employee available who is trained in first-aid, but any break requires hospital treatment. In a hospital setting, treatments vary according to degree of the injury. A common treatment is called a “reduction,” where a doctor places a bone back in its correct alignment. Doctors also can place limbs in a cast,\n\nThe most common wrist injury in gymnastics is a dorsal wrist impingement, which occurs when the back of the radius (one of the lower arm bones) strikes the wrist bones. This injury is aggravated whenever the body’s full weight is placed on the wrist. Common Injuries, Treatment, & Recovery 57\n\nDID YOU KNOW? The higher the gym- nastic level the more serious the injuries are. For example, 9 percent of amateur female gymnasts suffer from back abnormalities and injuries, while 63 per- cent of Olympic athletes reported problems with their spines. As you move up in ranks, make sure to be more cau- tious."

        "which temporarily immobilizes the injured area. Immobilization causes the range of motion to be limited; the cast ensures that no further injury can occur and that the bones can grow back together. In some extreme cases, a doctor may need to perform surgery. In surgery, parts of the bone are rearranged using screws or metal plates. An external frame is placed around the wound. Some- times metal bars will be used to connect surgical pins and screws that will hold the fractured bones together, creating greater stability while the bone heals. RETURNING TO TRAINING After a fracture has been reduced and immobi- lized, the body can now begin to heal itself naturally. The doctor will decide when a cast, brace, or frame can be removed. At that point, gentle training can resume. Caution is required because muscles, liga- ments, and bones weaken through lack of use. If a gymnast continues where she left off before the fracture, she will stress the injured area and likely cause a re-injury. Instead of going fully back into an exercise regimen, gradually increase pressure on the fractured limb over a period of weeks. Continue to do this until the bone is back to its normal form. HEALING DISLOCATIONS A doctor relocates a joint to a normal position after a dislocation. Similar techniques are used as after a fracture: the joint is temporarily immobilized. The healing time depends on the amount of damage to the ligament or mus- cles. The athlete should begin light exercises after four to six weeks of total inaction. 58 GYMNASTICS\n\nYounger athletes are more vulnerable to a re-dislocation after the first injury. Damaged ligaments are easily weakened or stretched back to the first dislocation. Eight-five percent of athletes ages sixteen to twenty-five will suf- fer another dislocation at a later date. Recovery for an athlete can take several months. Surgery may be needed to prevent re-injury. After medical attention, dislocations require gradual recovery. Make sure not to overload during training until the dislocated liga- ment is more flexible. Overuse Injury Half of all gymnastic injuries are caused by acci- dents, which happen suddenly. The other half of all injuries are caused by a gradual weakening of muscles, ligament, bone, or joint. These injuries are harder to detect and require more attention from the athlete. It is clear when a bone is broken; it is harder to stop an overuse injury before the problem becomes unbearable. Because of this, be conscious of these warning signs that indicate that a body part is injured or will be injured soon:\n\nstiffness when exercising a joint\n\nongoing pain in muscle or joint\n\ndecreased ability to stretch\n\nreduction in mobility of limbs. weakness in a particular body area\n\ninflammation in a joint or a muscle. DID YOU KNOW? A great way to ensure that you are avoiding overuse injury but are staying fit and active is to try another sport. Dr. George C. Branche III recommends, “If you’re playing different sports you learn to exercise muscles differently, you get a different training regimen and [chronic injuries are] less likely to happen.” Try to keep the other sport you practice as fun as possible. Don’t worry as much about winning or losing but rather on working out other areas of the body that you might not always use. uneven movements in a joint\n\nCommon Injuries, Treatment, & Recovery 59\n\nDID YOU KNOW? While overuse injuries happen because of poor techniques during train- ing, injury through an accident is three times more likely to occur. If any of these symptoms are severe, consult your coach or a doctor. Honesty is important: explain exactly how you feel. Do not put up with any pressure from anyone to continue training if you feel the symptoms listed above. If any coach or other authority figure pressures you to continue performing, this is a sign that person shouldn’t be in charge of your gymnastics career! A minor ache that is not treated can easily turn\n\ninto a painful injury. Do not ignore a buildup of pain. PREVENTING AND HEALING OVERUSE INJURIES While no single event causes an overuse injury, these injuries should be taken as seriously as a heavy fall or a bad landing. The single most important element of healing an overuse injury is rest. If the pain is bad enough, stop training altogether. If the injury is in one specific location, or localized, a gymnast can stop exercising only in that one location. If an athlete is in severe pain, she can use ice to reduce discomfort or stop swelling. A doctor can recommend a specific exercise plan to rehabilitate the injured body part. Once the problem is addressed, stretching and strengthen- ing exercises build muscles back to their former state. For dislocated joints, wear a support while healing and during future gymnastic activities. The start of an overuse injury could be normal wear-and-tear from gym- nastics, but it could also be caused by incorrect techniques. Specific tech- niques for almost all gymnastics are for the benefit of the athlete’s health. A few examples of incorrect techniques that can cause overuse injuries are:\n\nankle problems from incorrect foot alignment\n\na knee injury from landing incorrectly on vaults or dismounting from\n\nequipment\n\n60 GYMNASTICS\n\nPotential overuse injuries can easily be prevented. Back Injuries Due to the amount of flexibility involved, gymnasts are more at risk for back inju- ries than other athletes. Young female gymnasts are most vulnerable because their movements often involve curving their back, which can damage the spine. Female gymnasts between twelve and eighteen should be mindful of lower back pain; if pain continues, there is a 25 per- cent chance of a lower-back fracture or stress fracture. All gymnasts should be aware of these symptoms:\n\na painful ache in the lower back after a training session is completed\n\npain in the back or legs\n\nreduced mobility in the back, which prevents twisting or bending\n\na tingling, numb sensation in the arms or legs\n\nPain, tingling, or numbness in the legs can be a sign of a spinal injury. These feelings are caused when the spinal nerves that carry information between the spinal cord and the legs are damaged or pinched. Common Injuries, Treatment, & Recovery 61\n\nDID YOU KNOW? More than 25,000 gym- nasts under the age of fifteen are injured each year. Fifty-six percent of high-school gymnasts become injured during training. If any of these symptoms occur, consult your coach or doctor as soon as possible. A spine- damage injury could result in the athlete having to give up gymnastics. If there is a risk that spine damage has occurred, exercise should stop until a doctor gives a full diagnosis. For the doctor to identify the source of the back problem, she may x-ray or scan bones. If a back issue occurs, a doctor could recommend exercises to keep back muscles flexible and reduce tightening. The movements that caused the injury may need to be removed from the rou- tine. A potential back injury does not have to be the end of a gymnastics career, however; it could simply be a sign that more caution is needed. The risk of lower back injury for adolescents is highest during vigorous training where the body becomes too fatigued to allow for proper protection to the back. Incorrect movement techniques, weak stomach muscles, and poor leg stamina are some of the common causes of injuries. Understanding the Words A nutritionist is someone who specializes in helping people eat healthy diets. Moderation means in the middle—not too much, not too little. Synthesis means the process of putting something together. Something that is fortified is made stronger than it would have been otherwise."

Although practice and training are important parts of being safe and successful in gymnastics, you also need to think about what you take into your body. Athletes must be careful to eat a proper blend of nutrients to make sure their bodies and minds perform as well as they possibly can. This doesn’t just mean eating healthy foods but also choosing when to eat, how much to eat, and whether to take dietary supplements. Of course, when you choose a new diet or supplements, you should consult with a nutritionist, doctor, or some other expert. Don’t make up your own nutrition program! What to Eat While a balanced diet is important for everyone, it is even more important for athletes. Typically, an athlete has to eat considerably more than other people\n\nDaily caloric requirements depend on your age, sex, and activity level.

There are three main food groups to consider when choosing a diet: carbohydrates, protein, and fats."

        "DID YOU KNOW? Most citrus foods are high in vitamin C—so a smart move when eating lunch would be to drink orange juice along with fish or red meat. Doing this will maximize your body’s ability to process the iron. CARBOHyDRATES Carbohydrates are foods rich in a chemical called starch, which is what the body breaks down to get energy. Starchy foods include breads and grains, vegetables such as potatoes, cereal, pasta, and rice. Roughly half an athlete’s calories should\n\n66 GYMNASTICS\n\ncome from carbohydrates, but you should beware of heavily processed carbohydrates such as sug- ary foods and white bread made with bleached flour. These foods are quickly broken down into sugars, which the body processes into fats if it does not immediately burn them off. The best carbohydrate choices for an athlete are pasta and whole-grain foods, as well as starchy vegetables, which have vitamins as well as carbohydrates. A balanced diet avoids the “empty calories” supplied by white bread and sugars. Around 55 percent of a young athlete’s diet—a little more than half—should be in carbohydrates. DID YOU KNOW? Although vitamin C will help you absorb both iron and calcium bet- ter, if you eat calcium and iron together, they will interfere with your body’s ability to absorb each of them. Pasta is a good source of carbohydrates—choose a whole grain variety and eat it with some fresh vegetable for a healthy meal. Nutrition and Supplements 67\n\nMeat and eggs are good sources of protein, but should not be the only proteins you eat. Fish, nuts, and seeds should also be included because they contain protein as well as healthy fats. Cheese, which has protein, but also may be high in fat, should be eaten moderately. PROTEIN Proteins are important chemicals found in all liv- ing things; these chemicals are used to perform specific functions inside our body cells. Each pro- tein is a long, folded, chain-like molecule made up of “links” called amino acids. Our bodies can break down proteins that are found in foods into their base amino acids and use them to build new proteins that make up our muscles and bones. For this reason, during any exercise regimen, it is important to eat enough protein to give the body the building blocks it needs to become stronger. The best sources of proteins are meats and dairy products (such as milk or cheese), as well as eggs and certain vegetables (such as soy, beans, and rice). A good rule of thumb for how much protein\n\nDID YOU KNOW? To stay healthy and fit, a man may consume thousands more calories than a woman will. Also most men’s activities have a greater emphasis on arm strength and planche strength. Because of this, a diet richer in proteins and carbohy- drates is needed for a man. Women who are involved in gymnastics put more emphasis on following a low-calorie diet. 68 GYMNASTICS\n\nto eat is that the number of grams should be equal to about one-third of your body weight in pounds. For example, a 200-pound person should eat at least 60 or 70 grams of protein every day, or a 120-pound person should have roughly 40 grams of protein. FATS Lots of times, we think of fats as bad for us, since eating too much of them is unhealthy."

        "However, fat is an important ingredient needed to make our bodies work correctly. Without fats, our bodies cannot absorb certain vitamins as well. Also, our skin and hair need some amount of fat to grow correctly. However, fats should still be eaten in moderation—no more than 70 grams a day. The\n\nDID YOU KNOW? The U.S. government has created a new food pyramid to help us bet- ter understand healthy nutrition. Instead of the old pyramid’s emphasis on food arranged as a hierarchy, with one stacked up onto the other, the new pyramid emphasizes variety. Exercise is also part of the new pyramid, with a person walking up a set of stairs next to the pyramid. Cholesterol A lot of bad things have been said about cholesterol—but most of this bad press is focused on LDLs, or low-density lipopro- teins, which are a kind of cholesterol that can clog our blood vessels and make our hearts work harder. Our bodies make this cholesterol out of saturated fats, such as those found in animal fat from meats, butter, and whole milk. However, there is a kind of cholesterol known as HDLs, or high-density lipo- proteins, which have a good effect on the body. Increasing your HDL levels can be as easy as exercising regularly. Nutrition and Supplements 69\n\nA healthy diet should include a lot of whole grains, vegetables, fruits, and lean protein, but very few sugars and fats. best sources of fat are vegetable oils, olive oil, and nuts. Many foods con- tain saturated fats, which lead to the formation of cho- lesterol and can force your heart to work harder. MINERALS While all the major minerals are good for athletes, an athlete should make sure to consume two minerals in particular: calcium and iron. These two are also some of the minerals most likely to be under-consumed by a young athlete. Calcium is important to strengthen bones. It is especially needed for younger athletes whose bones are still developing. Unfortunately, the body often absorbs calcium poorly; usually, only 20 percent of the calcium in a diet is consumed from the original food. Drinking lots of milk with calcium-rich\n\n70 GYMNASTICS\n\nStaying Hydrated The best diet in the world is no good if you become dehy- drated. Dehydration occurs when your body doesn’t have enough water, leading to fatigue, dizziness, and headaches, all of which can hurt your performance when playing. It’s best to carry a bottle of water with you for the whole day before a practice or game to make sure that you are fully hydrated. In addition, you should be drinking water through- out the game to avoid becoming dehydrated as you sweat. Staying fully hydrated has many benefits besides helping your performance in the game—it can help mental concentra- tion, improves digestive health, and reduces the risk of kidney stones. cereal is best. Cheese is also an easy source to include as a snack or in a sandwich. Eating foods that contain vitamin C will also help you absorb calcium better. Iron is another mineral needed to keep a gymnast healthy. Red meat and fish, as well as tofu and black-eyed peas, are all foods that are heavy in iron. Eating foods that are rich in vitamin C will also help your body absorb iron better. Dietary Supplements Many athletes seek to improve their performance by taking dietary supple- ments, which are pills or drinks that contain nutrients or chemicals to improve their physical health or performance in the game. Dietary supplements do not\n\nNutrition and Supplements 71\n\ninclude illegal performance-enhancing drugs. Instead, they contain vitamins and minerals, or chemicals that help the body use vitamins more efficiently. Although when properly used, supplements can improve overall health and performance, you should always consult a doctor or some other expert before taking them. Some examples of common supplements include vitamin tab- lets, creatine, and protein shakes/powder. Everyone knows that milk is a good source of calcium, but it is not the only one. Many other foods can be excellent sources of this essential mineral. 72 GYMNASTICS\n\nVITAMIN TABLETS For many reasons, we do not always get the vitamins and nutrients we need.

These supplements, which are usually taken as a pill, sometimes contain a balanced mixture of vitamins and nutrients (known as a multivitamin), and sometimes they contain a single vitamin or mineral that our diet is lacking.

CREATINE Creatine is a specific protein that is naturally found in your body’s muscle cells. When taken in larger doses than is found in the body, creatine has the effect of increasing the rate of protein synthesis within your body cells. What this means is that you will have more energy to exercise, and you will see a greater improvement in strength and speed when you do exercise. However, putting any chemical into your body can have negative effects as well, and you should talk to a doctor before beginning to take creatine.

Gymnastics can have a negative effect on growth.

Some of these effects are permanent."

        "PROTEIN SUPPLEMENTS Getting enough protein from the food you eat can be difficult. Eating protein immediately after a workout is recommended (in order to refuel your body), but most people don’t feel up to cooking or preparing themselves a meal immediately after a workout. That’s why protein shakes are often a convenient choice. Many shakes contain blends of protein, carbohydrates, and fats, and some include vitamins, to help balance an athlete’s diet. Furthermore, having protein immediately after a workout can help repair the damage sustained by your muscles during the workout. However, you should remember that while protein shakes are useful for supplementing your diet, they should not be used to replace normal food in any significant quantities. You can get plenty of nutrients from a balanced diet that cannot be replaced by artificial protein shakes, regardless of how fortified they may be. A nutritionist can tell you how to fit protein or supplement shakes into your diet safely and effectively. Weight Issues and Gymnastics A healthy body image is a vital component of a career in gymnastics. Teenage female gymnasts are the group of young athletes most likely to be affected by an eating disorder. Nutrition and Supplements 75\n\nThe recommended energy intake for adolescent girls is approximately 1,700 calories per day, depending on height and weight and the amount they train. This is not dramatically far off from the average adult’s intake, which is 2,000 calories per day. Coaches, parents, and doctors should all stress the importance of good body composition rather than low weight. Weight is an arbitrary number that does not have any real effect on performance. Body mass is much more important; having more muscle mass than fat does make a real difference in performance. The athlete that tries to increase per- formance by following a dramatically reduced diet works against this goal, not for it. Nutritionists have proven that muscle mass is lost much easier than fat when following a low-calorie diet. Dieters may believe that a reduced weight will improve their appearance, but they are sabotaging their career in gymnastics. Some female athletes involved in “appearance sports,” such as ballet, gymnastics, figure skating, and diving develop a syndrome known as “The Female Athlete Triad,” which is characterized by eating disorders, osteoporosis, and menstrual problems. 76 GYMNASTICS\n\nDID YOU KNOW? Twenty years ago, the average model weighed 8 percent less than the average woman. Today’s models weight 23 percent less. PRESSURE There is an incredible amount of pressure on young women in American society to lose weight.

Female gymnasts are surrounded by images of ultra-skinny, rail-thin teenage gymnasts. Parents, coaches, and any other role models need to help teenage gymnasts maintain a healthy body image. Gender Differences and Eating Habits Gymnasts can start as young as five and most retire by their mid-twenties. Because of their age, gymnastic training affects a gymnast’s maturation. Not getting enough calories can permanently stunt an athlete’s growth. Diet affects males and females differently during puberty. While female gymnasts are more apt to suffer from eating disorders such as bulimia and anorexia, male athletes often have the same unhealthy eating habits that the rest of the population has, including the consumption of too much fat. These eating habits can also contribute to long-term health risks. This is not to say that male gymnasts are not at risk for eating disorders. Ten percent of male gymnasts will have an eating disorder, while less than 1 percent of the general male population suffer from an eating disorder. Being a gymnast is one of the factors that increase a man’s chances of having an eating disorder. Whether you’re male or female, good diet is essential to long-term success as a gymnast. 78 GYMNASTICS\n\nCathy Rigby Cathy Rigby, a very accomplished gymnast and actor, shocked the world when she began to speak publicly about her experience with eating disorders. In 1968, she was the highest-scoring U.S. gymnast in the Mexico City Olympics. She won a silver medal on the balance beam at the 1970 World Championship, which made her the first American woman to win a medal on a global scale. Her talents were not limited to gymnastics; she also performed Peter Pan in a Broadway musical. Cathy was married to Tommy Mason, a professional football player, and they had two sons. But not everything was going as well as it appeared on the surface: all the while, she was haunted by bulimia, an eating disorder."

        "She told People magazine in 1992, “I wanted to be perfect in my attitude and in my weight. Inside I was going\n\nNutrition and Supplements 79\n\ncrazy. I probably consumed 10,000 calories a day or more in fast foods. I can tell you where every McDonald’s and Jack in the Box was along the way [to my voice lessons]—and every bathroom where I could get rid of the food.”\n\nHow could such a talented athlete and actor keep such a dark demon secret for twelve years? Her story is a lesson to parents and coaches of female gymnasts: keep a sharp eye for warning signs of an eating disorder. Understanding the Words Diuretics are a type of drug that makes your body get rid of fluids by producing more urine. Diuretics have some legal medical uses: to lower blood pressure and to reduce pain from swelling and bloating. Amphetamines are stimulants, drugs that speed up your body’s reactions and processes. Electrolytes organize the electrically charged particles that are in body fluids such as blood. Your metabolism consists of all the processes that are constantly going on within your body. Stigma is a feeling or mark of shame in society. 82 GYMNASTICS\n\nAny substance intended to give an athlete an advantage over other players by altering something about his body is known as a performance-enhancing drug. Gymnasts most often abuse drugs that help them lose weight, such as diuretics and amphetamines. Gymnasts also sometimes abuse beta blockers or use blood doping. Diuretics Diuretics drain the body of liquids, which makes you weigh less. One of the most commonly abused diuretics is called furosemide. This drug can be used to shed water weight, and it is also used as a masking agent to hide other banned substances in an athlete’s blood stream. The World Anti-Doping Agency has banned furosemide and other diuretics from the Olympics. Furosemide is a veterinary drug used to prevent racehorses from bleeding and a prescription drug used to treat congestive heart failure.

        "Oftentimes, the source of the problem is unhealthy self- esteem that’s built on the desire to please others. By the nature of what they do, gymnasts are encouraged to seek attention and approval from others: their parents, coaches, and the audience. Dominique Dawes, the first African- American Olympic gold medalist in gymnastics, told Ebony magazine, “When you spend the majority of your childhood surrounded by an audience, you tend to seek applause.” Judges literally assign a number to a gymnast’s performance as a sign of approval or disapproval. Dominique, however, was able to grow into the mature under- standing that you need to please yourself first. She stated, “No matter what you do, you cannot please everyone, and that realization has helped me deal with my self-esteem issues.” She is now a motivational speaker, encouraging women across the country. 84 GYMNASTICS\n\nRecent Cases of Diuretic Use at the Olympics\n\nIn 2009, the FIG accused the first Brazilian woman to win at a World Gymnastics Championship, Daiane dos Santos, of abusing furosemide. Dos Santos made a statement that she had taken diuretics to reduce her weight while her knee was damaged. She stated that she did not know ahead of time that she was going to compete. Vietnam’s Do Thi Ngan Thuong also tested positive for furo- semide after competing in preliminary rounds of the 2008 Olympics and was suspended from competing for one year. And when Olympic officials accused Alina Kabayeva of tak- ing diuretics, she denied intentionally taking diuretics. The Russians’ head coach stated that Alina took a food supple- ment called “Hyper,” which contains furosemide. According to the coach, the gymnasts were taking it for premenstrual syndrome and had no idea the pills contained diuretics. Diuretics are not the only prescription drug that is misused. In 2006, there were over 740,000 emergency room visits that involved prescription or OTC drug misuse or abuse. The Dangers of Performance-Enhancing Drugs 85\n\nMany risks are associated with using diuretics. The fluid loss involved in diuretic abuse can result in diminished heart output, which reduces the ath- lete’s ability to breathe and can hinder athletic performance. Also, as more fluids are lost, the body’s ability to circulate blood to the skin and moder- ate body heat is often impaired. Other side effects include muscle cramp- ing, exhaustion, and even cardiac arrest. Some athletes have died because of a loss of regulatory cells in their blood, called electrolytes, while abusing diuretics. Amphetamines Amphetamines are more commonly known as speed.

Beta Blockers Beta blockers are legally used to manage uneven heart rates or hearts that are over taxed. Some people, however, use beta blockers to manage ner- vousness during an important performance. These drugs diminish the symp- toms associated with performance anxiety (pounding heart, cold and clammy hands, increased respiration, sweating, etc.), allowing anxious individuals to concentrate on the task at hand. While some young athletes do try to enhance their appearance or performance with illegal drug use, this study from the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse shows that participation in sports actually reduces the drug use among high school students. 88 GYMNASTICS\n\nBeta blockers are not approved for this use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and the International Olympic Committee has placed a ban on these drugs. Despite this, gymnasts may find beta blockers an appealing way to handle the pressure and anxiety of their sport. Like all drugs, beta blockers have undesired side effects. Habitual abuse of beta blockers decreases endurance, which has a detrimental effect on training and performance. Other side effects include dizziness, rashes, depression, confusion, and coldness in arms and legs. Sleep disturbances, hallucinations, and sudden unconscious- ness are among the most serious side effects involved in taking beta blockers. DID YOU KNOW?"

        "Steroids are abused far less in gymnastics than in other sports. One reason is that raw power is valued less in gymnastics than in other sports like football or even baseball. Blood Doping Blood doping is the injection of red blood cells or related blood products that contain red blood cells. This is usually done by extracting and storing an athlete’s own blood well in advance of a competition (so that the body can replenish its natural levels of red blood cells), and then injecting the stored blood immediately before competition. The resulting unnatural level of red blood cells improves oxygen transport and athletic endurance. Blood doping has been banned from athletic competitions. It is also a dan- gerous practice. Increasing the number of red blood cells in the blood stream makes blood thicker, which can also make it clot more easily. This in turn can increase the chances of heart attack and stroke. The blood can also be contaminated during storage, which can introduce infection into the athlete’s body. This contamination can lead to sepsis, an infection that affects the whole body. The Dangers of Performance-Enhancing Drugs 89\n\nGetting Caught The price of getting caught taking any of these illegal performance-enhancing drugs is very high. When an athlete achieves national or international status, and then officials catch him using performance-enhancing drugs, the results can be as dramatic as the loss of a medal. Drugs take away the pride of accomplishment and replace it with the stigma of being considered a cheater. Getting caught taking drugs can ruin careers that took years to build. On top of that, taking drugs is dangerous. It’s simply not worth it! The twists, twirls, bends, and stretches of gymnastics are an art form that requires great concentration, discipline, and many years of training. The sport demands that each gymnast be all she can be, physically and mentally. Ulti- mately, perhaps more than many other sports, gymnastics is also an art form. As gymnast Ivan Ivankov said, “It is through artistic gymnastics that I have experienced a lot of joy, pleasure, and satisfaction about my own physical abilities. ."
